Let me solve this problem following the systematic approach:

1. Initial State Analysis:
- Objects: b1 through b12
- Initial configuration:
  * b2 on b1 on b8 on b10 on b3 (on table)
  * b5 on b12 on b11 on b4 (on table)
  * b6 on b9 on b7 (on table)
  * Clear blocks: b2, b5, b6
  * Arm is empty

2. Goal State Analysis:
- Goal configuration requires:
  * b12 on b1 on b10 on b7
  * b2 on b5 on b6 on b9 on b12
  * b3 on b8
  * b11 on b4
- Main differences:
  * Many blocks need to be rearranged
  * Need to break current stacks and build new ones

3. Plan Generation:
Let's build the plan:
1. First, we need to disassemble the current stacks to free blocks
2. Then build new stacks according to goal state
3. We'll start with the highest blocks and work down

4. Plan Verification:
Here's the step-by-step plan with verification:

1. Unstack b2 from b1
2. Unstack b5 from b12
3. Unstack b6 from b9
4. Unstack b1 from b8
5. Unstack b8 from b10
6. Unstack b10 from b3
7. Unstack b9 from b7
8. Unstack b12 from b11
9. Unstack b11 from b4
10. Stack b10 on b7
11. Stack b1 on b10
12. Stack b12 on b1
13. Stack b9 on b12
14. Stack b6 on b9
15. Stack b5 on b6
16. Stack b2 on b5
17. Stack b3 on b8
18. Stack b11 on b4

Each action's preconditions are satisfied in sequence, and the final state matches the goal state.

Reasoning: The solution requires dismantling existing stacks first, then building new ones from the bottom up. We ensure each action is valid by checking preconditions (clear blocks and arm-empty) before each move.
