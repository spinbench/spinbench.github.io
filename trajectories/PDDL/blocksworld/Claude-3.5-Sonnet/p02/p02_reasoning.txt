Let me solve this problem following the systematic approach:

1. Initial State Analysis:
- Objects: b1 through b10
- Initial configuration:
  * b1 is on b2 (b2 on table)
  * b4 is on b3 (b3 on table)
  * b5 is on b9 (b9 on table)
  * b6 is on b8, b8 is on b7, b7 is on b10, b10 is on b4
  * Clear blocks: b1, b5, b6
  * Arm is empty

2. Goal State Analysis:
- Required configurations:
  * b1 on b5
  * b4 on b3
  * b5 on b4
  * b6 on b9
  * b7 on b10
  * b9 on b2
- Main gaps:
  * Need to rearrange the stack containing b6->b8->b7->b10->b4
  * Need to free b5 and b9 for new positions

3. Plan Generation:
1. First, we need to dismantle the tall stack:
   - Unstack b6 from b8
   - Unstack b8 from b7
   - Unstack b7 from b10
   - Unstack b10 from b4
2. Then rearrange blocks to achieve goal state:
   - Unstack b5 from b9
   - Unstack b1 from b2
3. Build goal configuration:
   - Stack b9 on b2
   - Stack b4 on b3
   - Stack b5 on b4
   - Stack b1 on b5
   - Stack b7 on b10
   - Stack b6 on b9

4. Plan Verification:
- Each action maintains clear and holding predicates correctly
- The sequence allows for proper dismantling and rebuilding
- All preconditions are satisfied before each action
- Final state matches goal conditions

Reasoning: The solution requires careful dismantling of existing stacks before building the goal configuration. We first free up all blocks involved in the goal state, then rebuild according to the goal specifications.
