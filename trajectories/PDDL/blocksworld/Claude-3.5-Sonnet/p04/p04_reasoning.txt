Let me solve this problem systematically.

1. Initial State Analysis:
- Objects: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8
- Initial configuration:
  * b6 is on top of b5
  * b5 is on top of b3
  * b3 is on top of b7
  * b7 is on top of b2
  * b2 is on top of b8
  * b4 is on top of b1
  * b1 and b8 are on table
  * b4 and b6 are clear
  * Arm is empty

2. Goal State Analysis:
- Goal conditions:
  * b1 should be under b8
  * b1 should be on b6
  * b6 should be on b2
  * b5 should be on b4
  * b4 should be on b7
- Main gaps: Need to completely disassemble current stack and rebuild in new configuration

3. Plan Generation:
1. Start with clear blocks (b4, b6) and work down
2. Need to disassemble to get pieces in correct positions
3. Then rebuild according to goal state

4. Plan Verification:
Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Unstack b4 from b1 (clear b4, arm-empty)
2. Put down b4 (holding b4)
3. Unstack b6 from b5 (clear b6, arm-empty)
4. Put down b6 (holding b6)
5. Unstack b5 from b3 (clear b5, arm-empty)
6. Put down b5 (holding b5)
7. Unstack b3 from b7 (clear b3, arm-empty)
8. Put down b3 (holding b3)
9. Unstack b7 from b2 (clear b7, arm-empty)
10. Put down b7 (holding b7)
11. Unstack b2 from b8 (clear b2, arm-empty)
12. Put down b2 (holding b2)
13. Pickup b6 (clear b6, on-table b6)
14. Stack b6 on b2 (holding b6, clear b2)
15. Pickup b1 (clear b1, on-table b1)
16. Stack b1 on b6 (holding b1, clear b6)
17. Pickup b8 (clear b8, on-table b8)
18. Stack b8 on b1 (holding b8, clear b1)
19. Pickup b4 (clear b4, on-table b4)
20. Stack b4 on b7 (holding b4, clear b7)
21. Pickup b5 (clear b5, on-table b5)
22. Stack b5 on b4 (holding b5, clear b4)

Reasoning: The plan first disassembles all stacks to get access to needed blocks, then rebuilds according to goal state, ensuring all preconditions are met at each step.
