Let me solve this problem following the systematic approach:

1. Initial State Analysis:
- Objects: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7
- Initial configuration:
  * b2 is on b7
  * b7 is on b3
  * b3 is on b5
  * b5 is on table
  * b4 is on b6
  * b6 is on b1
  * b1 is on table
  * Clear blocks: b2, b4
  * Arm is empty

2. Goal State Analysis:
- Required configurations:
  * b1 on b5
  * b2 on b4
  * b4 on b6
  * b5 on b7
- Main gaps:
  * Need to completely disassemble current stacks
  * Need to rebuild in new configuration

3. Plan Generation:
1. First, we need to disassemble the top stack (b2->b7->b3->b5):
   - Unstack b2 from b7
   - Unstack b7 from b3
   - Unstack b3 from b5

2. Then disassemble the other stack (b4->b6->b1):
   - Unstack b4 from b6
   - Unstack b6 from b1

3. Build new configuration:
   - Stack b5 on b7
   - Stack b1 on b5
   - Stack b4 on b6
   - Stack b2 on b4

4. Plan Verification:
Let me verify each step maintains valid preconditions and achieves the goal:

```
(unstack b2 b7)    // b2 is clear and on b7
(putdown b2)       // holding b2
(unstack b7 b3)    // b7 is now clear
(putdown b7)       // holding b7
(unstack b3 b5)    // b3 is now clear
(putdown b3)       // holding b3
(unstack b4 b6)    // b4 is clear and on b6
(putdown b4)       // holding b4
(unstack b6 b1)    // b6 is now clear
(putdown b6)       // holding b6
(pickup b5)        // b5 is clear and on table
(stack b5 b7)      // b7 is on table and clear
(pickup b1)        // b1 is clear and on table
(stack b1 b5)      // b5 is clear
(pickup b4)        // b4 is clear and on table
(stack b4 b6)      // b6 is clear
(pickup b2)        // b2 is clear and on table
(stack b2 b4)      // b4 is clear
```

This achieves all goal conditions: b1 on b5, b2 on b4, b4 on b6, and b5 on b7.

Reasoning: The solution first dismantles the existing stacks to free all blocks, then rebuilds them in the goal configuration, ensuring each action's preconditions are met before execution.
