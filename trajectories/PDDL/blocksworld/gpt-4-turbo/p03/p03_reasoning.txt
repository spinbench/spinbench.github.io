### Reasoning:

#### 1. Initial State Analysis:
- **Objects and Initial States:**
  - b1 on b4
  - b2 on b5
  - b3 on b1
  - b4 on-table
  - b5 on b6
  - b6 on-table
  - clear b2
  - clear b3
  - arm-empty

- **Available Actions and Preconditions:**
  - **pickup(?ob)**: Requires ?ob to be clear, on-table, and arm-empty.
  - **putdown(?ob)**: Requires holding ?ob.
  - **stack(?ob, ?underob)**: Requires ?ob to be held and ?underob to be clear.
  - **unstack(?ob, ?underob)**: Requires ?ob to be on ?underob, ?ob to be clear, and arm-empty.

#### 2. Goal State Analysis:
- **Goal Conditions:**
  - on b3 b6
  - on b5 b2
  - on b6 b5

- **Gap Analysis:**
  - b3 needs to be moved from b1 to b6.
  - b5 needs to be moved from b6 to b2.
  - b6 needs to be re-stacked under b5.

#### 3. Plan Generation:
- **Step-by-Step Plan:**
  1. **unstack(b3, b1)**: b3 is clear and on b1, and the arm is empty.
     - Effects: holding b3, b1 becomes clear, arm not empty.
  2. **putdown(b3)**: b3 is held.
     - Effects: b3 on-table, clear, arm-empty.
  3. **unstack(b2, b5)**: b2 is clear and on b5, and the arm is empty.
     - Effects: holding b2, b5 becomes clear, arm not empty.
  4. **putdown(b2)**: b2 is held.
     - Effects: b2 on-table, clear, arm-empty.
  5. **unstack(b5, b6)**: b5 is on b6 and clear, and the arm is empty.
     - Effects: holding b5, b6 becomes clear, arm not empty.
  6. **stack(b5, b2)**: b5 is held and b2 is clear.
     - Effects: b5 on b2, b2 not clear, arm-empty.
  7. **pickup(b3)**: b3 is clear, on-table, and arm-empty.
     - Effects: holding b3, b3 not clear, not on-table, arm not empty.
  8. **stack(b3, b6)**: b3 is held and b6 is clear.
     - Effects: b3 on b6, b6 not clear, arm-empty.

#### 4. Plan Verification:
- **Simulate Plan Execution:**
  - After each action, the state changes as described in the effects. Each action's preconditions are met based on the previous state.
  - Final state should match the goal state.

#### 5. Solution Output:
$$
{
 "plan": "(unstack b3 b1)\n(putdown b3)\n(unstack b2 b5)\n(putdown b2)\n(unstack b5 b6)\n(stack b5 b2)\n(pickup b3)\n(stack b3 b6)"
}
$$

This plan systematically achieves the goal state by rearranging the blocks as specified in the goal conditions, ensuring all actions are valid and executable in sequence.
