Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. 

Starting with the Initial State Analysis. The objects are blocks b1 to b7. From the initial state, I see:

- b1 is on the table, and b6 is on b1. Then b4 is on b6. Also, b4 is clear.
- b5 is on the table, and b3 is on b5. Then b7 is on b3, and b2 is on b7. So the stack here is b2 on b7 on b3 on b5 (table). But wait, the initial says on b2 b7, on b7 b3, on b3 b5. So the stack is b2 -> b7 -> b3 -> b5 (table). But wait, the initial says on-table b5. So b3 is on b5, which is on the table. Then b7 is on b3, and b2 is on b7. So the stack from bottom up: b5 (table), b3, b7, b2. And b2 is clear. Also, b4 is on b6, which is on b1 (table). So the other stack is b4 on b6 on b1 (table). 

So initial state:

- On-table: b1, b5
- On b2 b7
- On b7 b3
- On b3 b5
- On b4 b6
- On b6 b1
- Clear blocks: b2, b4 (since nothing is on top of them)
- Arm is empty.

Now the Goal State Analysis. The goal requires:

(on b1 b5), (on b2 b4), (on b4 b6), (on b5 b7). 

So let's break down each part:

- b1 must be on b5. Currently, b1 is on the table, and b5 is on the table. So we need to move b1 from the table to b5. But first, b5 must be clear. However, in the initial state, b3 is on b5, so we need to clear b5.

- b2 must be on b4. Currently, b2 is on b7. So we need to move b2 to b4. But b4 is currently on b6. So after moving b4, perhaps?

Wait, the goal says on b4 b6. So b4 should be on b6. In the initial state, b4 is already on b6. So that part is already satisfied. Wait, the initial state has (on b4 b6) and (on b6 b1). So the goal (on b4 b6) is already met. So that's one condition already satisfied. But the goal also has (on b2 b4), so we need to place b2 on top of b4. But currently, b4 is clear, so that's possible once we have b2 in hand.

Then, (on b5 b7). Currently, b5 is on the table, and b7 is on b3. So to put b5 on b7, we need to have b7 clear. But in the initial state, b7 is under b2. So first, we need to move b2 off of b7. Then, perhaps move b7 to a position where we can stack b5 on it.

But wait, the goal requires b5 to be on b7. So the stack would be b5 on b7, which is on something else. Let's see. The initial state has b7 on b3, which is on b5. So if we need to have b5 on b7, that would require moving b5 from the table (since initially it's on the table) to be on top of b7. But currently, b7 is under b2. So first, we need to clear b7 by moving b2, then maybe move b7 to a position where we can stack b5 on it. But how?

Wait, the initial state's stack is b2 on b7 on b3 on b5 (on table). So to get b5 on b7, we need to have b7 somewhere else. Because currently, b7 is on b3, which is on b5. So perhaps we need to move b3 and b7 first. Let's think.

Let me outline the steps needed:

1. To get b1 on b5: Currently, b1 is under b6 (since b6 is on b1). So we need to move b6 and b4 first. Because b4 is on b6, which is on b1. So to move b1, we need to clear it. But b6 is on b1. So first, we need to unstack b4 from b6, then unstack b6 from b1. Then, we can move b1 to b5.

But wait, the goal requires b4 to be on b6. So after moving b4 and b6, we need to put them back. Wait, the goal says (on b4 b6) and (on b2 b4). So the stack would be b2 on b4 on b6. But in the initial state, b4 is on b6, which is on b1. So perhaps the plan is to move b4 and b6, then put them back in the same position but with b2 on top of b4. Hmm, but the goal requires that b4 is on b6, which is already true. So maybe we don't need to move them. Wait, but the initial state has b4 on b6, which is on b1. The goal requires b4 on b6, but the position of b6 might not matter as long as it's under b4. Wait, the goal's (on b4 b6) is already satisfied. So that part is already done. So the only thing needed for that part is to put b2 on b4. But currently, b4 is clear, so we can pick up b2 and stack it on b4. But wait, b2 is currently on b7. So we need to unstack b2 from b7 first.

So let's start with that. To get b2 on b4, we need to:

- Unstack b2 from b7. Since b2 is clear, and the arm is empty, we can do unstack b2 b7. That would give us holding b2, and clear b7. Then, stack b2 on b4. But to stack, we need b4 to be clear. It is clear in the initial state, so after unstacking b2, we can stack it on b4. But wait, after unstacking b2, the arm is holding b2. Then, stack b2 on b4. That would require that b4 is clear. Which it is. So that's possible.

But wait, after stacking b2 on b4, the goal (on b2 b4) is achieved. But the goal also requires (on b4 b6), which is already true. So that part is done.

Next, the goal requires (on b1 b5). Currently, b1 is under b6. So to move b1, we need to clear it. But b6 is on b1. So we need to move b6. But b6 is under b4. So first, we need to unstack b4 from b6. But in the initial state, b4 is on b6, which is on b1. So to unstack b4, we need to have the arm empty. Let's see:

Current initial steps:

1. Unstack b2 from b7. Then stack b2 on b4. That would take care of (on b2 b4).

But after that, we need to handle the other goals. Let's see:

After stacking b2 on b4, the stack would be b2 on b4 on b6 on b1. Then, to get b1 on b5, we need to move b6 and b4 and b2. Wait, but the goal requires b4 to be on b6, which is already the case. So perhaps moving b6 and b1 is necessary.

Wait, the goal (on b1 b5) requires that b1 is on top of b5. Currently, b1 is on the table. So we need to pick up b1 and place it on b5. But to pick up b1, it must be clear. However, in the initial state, b6 is on b1. So we need to first remove b6 from b1. But b6 is under b4. So to move b6, we need to first remove b4. But b4 is under b2 (after we stack b2 on b4). Wait, no. If we stack b2 on b4, then b4 is under b2, so b4 is not clear anymore. So after stacking b2 on b4, the stack is b2 on b4 on b6 on b1. So to move b6, we need to first unstack b2 from b4, then unstack b4 from b6, then unstack b6 from b1. That's a lot of steps. But the goal requires that b4 is on b6, which would still be true if we don't move them. Wait, but the goal says (on b4 b6), which is already satisfied. So perhaps after moving b2 to b4, we can leave b4 and b6 as they are. Then, to move b1, we need to clear it. But b6 is on b1. So we need to move b6. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the order of achieving the goals matters. Let's think about dependencies. The goal (on b1 b5) requires that b5 is clear. Because to place b1 on b5, b5 must be clear. But in the initial state, b3 is on b5. So we need to clear b5. Then, after that, we can place b1 on b5.

So let's look at the other part of the goal: (on b5 b7). So b5 must be on top of b7. Currently, b5 is on the table, and b7 is on b3. So to put b5 on b7, we need to have b7 clear. But b7 is under b2 in the initial state. So first, we need to move b2, then move b7. But after moving b2 to b4, as per the earlier step, then b7 is clear. Then, we can move b7. But where? Because the goal requires b5 to be on b7. So perhaps we need to move b7 to a position where we can stack b5 on it. But how?

Wait, the goal requires (on b5 b7). So b5 must be on top of b7. So the stack would be b5 on b7. But where is b7? Let's see. Currently, b7 is on b3, which is on b5. So if we move b7, perhaps we need to place it on the table or on another block. But the goal doesn't specify where b7 is, except that b5 is on it. So perhaps after moving b7 to the table, then we can stack b5 on it. But then, we need to have b7 on the table. Let's see.

So steps could be:

1. Unstack b2 from b7 (since b2 is clear, arm is empty). Now holding b2, clear b7.

2. Stack b2 on b4 (since b4 is clear). Now, b2 is on b4, which is on b6, which is on b1. So that achieves (on b2 b4).

3. Now, need to handle b5 and b7. To get b5 on b7, we need to have b7 somewhere. Let's see. Currently, after step 1, b7 is clear. So we can unstack b7 from b3. Wait, but in the initial state, b7 is on b3. So after step 1, b7 is still on b3. So to unstack b7 from b3, we need to have the arm empty. After step 2, the arm is empty again. So step 3 could be unstack b7 from b3. Preconditions: on b7 b3, clear b7 (which is true after step 1), arm empty. So unstack b7 b3. Then, holding b7. Then, we can put it down on the table (putdown b7) or stack it somewhere else. But the goal requires b5 to be on b7. So perhaps we need to place b7 on the table, then stack b5 on it. But b5 is currently under b3 and b7. Wait, initial state: b3 is on b5. So after unstacking b7 from b3, we can then unstack b3 from b5. Let's see:

After step 3 (unstack b7 from b3), we have holding b7. Then, we can put it down (putdown b7), making it on the table. Then, we can unstack b3 from b5 (since after removing b7, b3 is clear). So unstack b3 from b5. Then, putdown b3. Now, b5 is clear. Then, we can pick up b5 and stack it on b7 (which is on the table). But wait, the goal requires b5 to be on b7. So if b7 is on the table, then stacking b5 on b7 would require that b7 is clear. So after putting b7 on the table, we can stack b5 on it. But to do that, we need to have b5 in hand. So steps:

3. unstack b7 b3 → holding b7

4. putdown b7 → on-table b7, arm empty.

5. unstack b3 b5 → holding b3 (since b3 is on b5, and after step 3, b3 is clear? Wait, after step 3, we took b7 from b3. So b3 is now clear. So yes, we can unstack b3 from b5. So unstack b3 b5 → holding b3.

6. putdown b3 → on-table b3.

7. Now, b5 is clear. So pickup b5 → holding b5.

8. stack b5 b7 → since b7 is on the table and clear. This would make on b5 b7, which is part of the goal.

Then, we need to handle b1. The goal requires b1 to be on b5. But currently, b1 is under b6. So we need to clear b1. To do that, we need to move b6. But b6 is under b4 and b2. So after step 2, b2 is on b4, which is on b6. So to move b6, we need to first unstack b2 and b4.

So steps after step 8:

9. unstack b2 b4 → holding b2. Preconditions: on b2 b4, clear b2 (which is true), arm empty (after step 8, the arm is empty after stacking b5 on b7). Wait, step 8's effect is that the arm is empty. So yes, we can unstack b2 from b4.

10. putdown b2 → on-table b2.

11. unstack b4 b6 → holding b4. Preconditions: on b4 b6, clear b4 (after step 9, b4 is clear because we removed b2). So yes.

12. putdown b4 → on-table b4.

13. unstack b6 b1 → holding b6. Preconditions: on b6 b1, clear b6 (after steps 11 and 12, b6 is clear). So yes.

14. putdown b6 → on-table b6.

15. Now, b1 is clear. So pickup b1 → holding b1.

16. stack b1 b5 → since b5 is on b7 (from step 8), and b5 is clear (after step 8, stacking b5 on b7 makes b5 clear? Wait, when you stack a block on another, the top block is clear. So after step 8, b5 is on b7. So b5 is clear. So yes, we can stack b1 on b5.

But wait, the goal requires (on b1 b5), which this step achieves.

But then, after step 16, we have:

- b1 on b5, which is on b7 (on the table? No, b7 was put on the table in step 4. So b7 is on the table. Then, b5 is stacked on b7 (step 8), so b5 is on b7 (table). Then, b1 is stacked on b5 (step 16). So that's correct.

But wait, the goal also requires (on b5 b7), which is achieved in step 8.

So now, all the goals are achieved except for (on b4 b6). Wait, after step 12, we putdown b4 on the table. So (on b4 b6) is no longer true. But the goal requires (on b4 b6). So we need to put b4 back on b6. But in step 11, we unstacked b4 from b6 and put it down. So we need to restack b4 on b6. But after step 14, b6 is on the table. So steps after step 16:

17. pickup b4 → since it's on the table and clear. Preconditions: clear b4 (yes, after step 12, it's on the table and nothing is on it), on-table b4, arm empty (after step 16, arm is empty). So yes.

18. stack b4 b6 → since b6 is on the table and clear. So after stacking, b4 is on b6. That satisfies (on b4 b6).

But then, the goal also requires (on b2 b4). But after step 10, b2 is on the table. So we need to move b2 back on top of b4. So steps:

19. pickup b2 → on-table b2, clear, arm empty.

20. stack b2 b4 → since b4 is on b6 (after step 18), and b4 is clear (after stacking, the top block is clear). Wait, after stacking b4 on b6, b4 is clear. So yes, we can stack b2 on b4.

So now, all goals are achieved.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Let me check if there's a more efficient way.

Alternative approach: Let's see the dependencies. The goals are:

- on b1 b5

- on b2 b4

- on b4 b6 (already true initially)

- on b5 b7

But wait, the initial state has on b4 b6, so that's already satisfied. So the goal is to maintain that. But when we move b4, we have to put it back. So perhaps we can avoid moving b4 and b6.

Wait, the initial state has b4 on b6 on b1. The goal requires b4 on b6 (already true) and b2 on b4. So to achieve that, we need to stack b2 on b4. But b4 is on b6. So we can do that by unstacking b2 from b7, then stack on b4. That's steps 1 and 2. Then, the (on b2 b4) is achieved, and (on b4 b6) remains true.

Then, the other goals are (on b1 b5) and (on b5 b7). 

For (on b5 b7), we need to move b5 from the table to b7. But initially, b5 is under b3 and b7. So first, we need to clear b5. To clear b5, we need to remove b3. But b3 is under b7 and b2. Wait, initial stack is b2 on b7 on b3 on b5. So to clear b5, we need to remove b3. To remove b3, we need to first remove b7 and b2.

So steps:

1. unstack b2 from b7 → holding b2.

2. stack b2 on b4 → done.

3. unstack b7 from b3 → holding b7.

4. putdown b7 → on-table b7.

5. unstack b3 from b5 → holding b3.

6. putdown b3 → on-table b3.

Now, b5 is clear. So we can pick it up and stack on b7.

7. pickup b5 → holding b5.

8. stack b5 on b7 → on b5 b7.

Now, for (on b1 b5), we need to move b1 from under b6. So:

9. unstack b4 from b6 → but wait, after step 2, b4 has b2 on top. So we can't unstack b4 until we remove b2.

So steps:

9. unstack b2 from b4 → holding b2.

10. putdown b2 → on-table b2.

11. unstack b4 from b6 → holding b4.

12. putdown b4 → on-table b4.

13. unstack b6 from b1 → holding b6.

14. putdown b6 → on-table b6.

15. pickup b1 → holding b1.

16. stack b1 on b5 → on b1 b5.

But now, we have to put b4 back on b6 and b2 back on b4.

17. pickup b4 → clear, on-table.

18. stack b4 on b6 → on b4 b6.

19. pickup b2 → clear, on-table.

20. stack b2 on b4 → on b2 b4.

So this approach also requires 20 steps. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps after step 8 (stack b5 on b7), we can work on moving b1. But to move b1, we need to clear it by moving b6. But b6 is under b4 and b2. So after step 2, b2 is on b4. So to move b6, we need to unstack b2 and b4.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move b6 and b1 without disturbing b4 and b2. But since b4 is on b6, moving b6 would require moving b4 first. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, after step 2 (stack b2 on b4), can we unstack b4 from b6? No, because b4 has b2 on top. So we need to first unstack b2.

So steps:

After step 2 (stack b2 on b4):

3. unstack b2 from b4 → holding b2.

4. putdown b2 → on-table b2.

5. unstack b4 from b6 → holding b4.

6. unstack b6 from b1 → holding b6.

7. putdown b6 → on-table b6.

8. pickup b1 → holding b1.

9. stack b1 on b5 → on b1 b5.

But then, we need to put b4 back on b6 and b2 back on b4.

10. stack b4 on b6 → on b4 b6.

11. pickup b2 → stack on b4.

But this approach skips some steps related to moving b7 and b3. Wait, but we also need to handle the (on b5 b7) goal. So perhaps this approach is missing steps.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the necessary steps in order of dependencies.

The main dependencies are:

- To place b1 on b5, we need to clear b1 (move b6 and b4) and have b5 clear (move b3 and b7).

- To place b5 on b7, we need to have b7 clear (move b2 and b7's stack) and then place b5 on it.

So perhaps the optimal plan is:

1. Move b2 from b7 to b4.

2. Move b7 from b3 to table.

3. Move b3 from b5 to table.

4. Move b5 to b7.

5. Move b6 and b4 to access b1.

6. Move b1 to b5.

But let's see:

Step 1: unstack b2 from b7 → stack on b4.

Step 2: unstack b7 from b3 → putdown.

Step 3: unstack b3 from b5 → putdown.

Step 4: pickup b5 → stack on b7.

Now, b5 is on b7.

Then, to move b1:

Step 5: unstack b2 from b4 → putdown.

Step 6: unstack b4 from b6 → putdown.

Step 7: unstack b6 from b1 → putdown.

Step 8: pickup b1 → stack on b5.

Then, need to put back b4 and b2:

Step 9: pickup b4 → stack on b6.

Step 10: pickup b2 → stack on b4.

This totals 10 steps. But wait, let's count:

1. unstack b2 b7

2. stack b2 b4

3. unstack b7 b3

4. putdown b7

5. unstack b3 b5

6. putdown b3

7. pickup b5

8. stack b5 b7

9. unstack b2 b4

10. putdown b2

11. unstack b4 b6

12. putdown b4

13. unstack b6 b1

14. putdown b6

15. pickup b1

16. stack b1 b5

17. pickup b4

18. stack b4 b6

19. pickup b2

20. stack b2 b4

That's 20 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach: Let's see if we can reuse some steps. For example, after moving b2 to b4, we can then move b7 and b3 to clear b5, then move b5 to b7. Then, move b6 and b4 to clear b1, move b1 to b5, and then put b4 and b2 back.

But this seems similar to the previous plan.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving b2 to b4, we can unstack b4 from b6 (but since b2 is on b4, we can't). So we need to first remove b2.

So steps:

1. unstack b2 b7 → holding b2.

2. stack b2 b4 → done.

3. unstack b2 b4 → holding b2. (But why? To free b4.)

Wait, this seems redundant. Maybe not.

Alternatively, after step 2, to move b4, we need to unstack b2 first.

So:

3. unstack b2 b4 → holding b2.

4. putdown b2.

5. unstack b4 b6 → holding b4.

6. putdown b4.

7. unstack b6 b1 → holding b6.

8. putdown b6.

9. pickup b1 → stack on b5.

But then, we need to handle the other parts.

This is getting quite involved. Let's try to outline the steps systematically.

Let me list all the required actions in order:

1. Unstack b2 from b7 to clear b7 and get b2 in hand.

2. Stack b2 on b4 to achieve (on b2 b4).

3. Unstack b7 from b3 to clear b3.

4. Putdown b7 to have it on the table.

5. Unstack b3 from b5 to clear b5.

6. Putdown b3.

7. Pickup b5 to move it.

8. Stack b5 on b7 to achieve (on b5 b7).

Now, b5 is on b7, which is on the table.

Next, handle b1:

9. Unstack b2 from b4 to clear b4.

10. Putdown b2.

11. Unstack b4 from b6 to clear b6.

12. Putdown b4.

13. Unstack b6 from b1 to clear b1.

14. Putdown b6.

15. Pickup b1.

16. Stack b1 on b5 to achieve (on b1 b5).

Now, we need to restore (on b4 b6) and (on b2 b4):

17. Pickup b4.

18. Stack b4 on b6.

19. Pickup b2.

20. Stack b2 on b4.

This gives us all the goals. Each action's preconditions must be checked.

Let's verify each step:

1. unstack b2 b7:

   Pre: on b2 b7, clear b2, arm-empty. Initial state has these. Effects: holding b2, clear b7.

2. stack b2 b4:

   Pre: holding b2, clear b4. After step 1, holding b2. b4 is clear initially. Effects: on b2 b4, arm empty, clear b2, not clear b4.

3. unstack b7 b3:

   Pre: on b7 b3, clear b7 (after step 1, b7 is clear), arm empty (after step 2). Effects: holding b7, clear b3.

4. putdown b7:

   Pre: holding b7. Effects: on-table b7, arm empty.

5. unstack b3 b5:

   Pre: on b3 b5, clear b3 (after step 3, b3 is clear), arm empty. Effects: holding b3, clear b5.

6. putdown b3:

   Pre: holding b3. Effects: on-table b3, arm empty.

7. pickup b5:

   Pre: on-table b5, clear b5 (after step 5), arm empty. Effects: holding b5.

8. stack b5 b7:

   Pre: holding b5, clear b7 (after step 4, b7 is on table and clear). Effects: on b5 b7, arm empty.

9. unstack b2 b4:

   Pre: on b2 b4, clear b2 (after step 2, b2 is on top, so clear), arm empty. Effects: holding b2, clear b4.

10. putdown b2:

    Pre: holding b2. Effects: on-table b2, arm empty.

11. unstack b4 b6:

    Pre: on b4 b6, clear b4 (after step 9, b4 is clear), arm empty. Effects: holding b4, clear b6.

12. putdown b4:

    Pre: holding b4. Effects: on-table b4, arm empty.

13. unstack b6 b1:

    Pre: on b6 b1, clear b6 (after step 11, b6 is clear), arm empty. Effects: holding b6, clear b1.

14. putdown b6:

    Pre: holding b6. Effects: on-table b6, arm empty.

15. pickup b1:

    Pre: on-table b1 (after step 14, b1 is clear and on table). Effects: holding b1.

16. stack b1 b5:

    Pre: holding b1, clear b5 (after step 8, b5 is on b7 and clear). Effects: on b1 b5, arm empty.

17. pickup b4:

    Pre: on-table b4 (step 12), clear b4, arm empty. Effects: holding b4.

18. stack b4 b6:

    Pre: holding b4, clear b6 (after step 14, b6 is on table and clear). Effects: on b4 b6, arm empty.

19. pickup b2:

    Pre: on-table b2 (step 10), clear b2, arm empty. Effects: holding b2.

20. stack b2 b4:

    Pre: holding b2, clear b4 (after step 18, b4 is on b6 and clear). Effects: on b2 b4, arm empty.

After all these steps, the goal conditions are met:

- on b1 b5 (step 16)

- on b2 b4 (step 20)

- on b4 b6 (step 18)

- on b5 b7 (step 8)

This seems to cover all the goals. Now, let's check if each action's preconditions are met at the time of execution.

Yes, each step's preconditions are satisfied based on the previous actions' effects.

Now, the final plan is the sequence of these 20 actions. But perhaps there's a shorter way. For example, after step 8, when b5 is on b7, and we need to move b1, maybe we can find a way to move b6 and b4 without having to put them down and pick them up again. But given the current actions available (only pickup, putdown, stack, unstack), it's necessary to unstack and putdown each block to clear the way.

Alternatively, maybe some steps can be optimized. For example, after step 5 (unstack b3 b5), instead of putting b3 down, can we stack it somewhere else? But since the goal doesn't require anything about b3, it's okay to put it on the table.

Another possible optimization: After step 3 (unstack b7 b3), instead of putting b7 down, can we stack it on another block? But since we need to have b5 on b7, it's better to put b7 on the table so that we can stack b5 on it.

Overall, the plan seems valid, albeit lengthy. Each action is necessary to achieve the goals step by step.
