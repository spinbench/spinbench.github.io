Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal conditions. 

Starting with the Initial State Analysis. The objects are blocks b1 to b10. From the initial state, let's list their positions:

- b1 is on b2, which is on the table. So the stack here is b1 on b2 (table).
- b3 is on the table, and b4 is on b3. So stack: b4 on b3 (table).
- b5 is on b9, which is on the table. So stack: b5 on b9 (table).
- b6 is on b8, which is on b7, which is on b10. But wait, the initial says on b7 b10, and on b8 b7. So the stack here is b6 on b8 on b7 on b10. Then where is b10? The initial also says on b10 b4. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, let me parse the initial again.

Looking at the initial conditions:

(on b1 b2)
(on-table b2)
(on-table b3)
(on b4 b3)
(on b5 b9)
(on b6 b8)
(on b7 b10)
(on b8 b7)
(on-table b9)
(on b10 b4)
(clear b1)
(clear b5)
(clear b6)

Wait, this seems a bit complex. Let's map each block's position:

- b2 is on the table, with b1 on top. So stack: b1 on b2 (table). Clear: b1 is clear (since nothing is on it). But wait, the clear predicates list includes clear b1, b5, b6. So yes, those are clear.

- b3 is on table, with b4 on top. So stack: b4 on b3 (table). But then, the initial also says on b10 b4. Wait, that's a problem. Because if b10 is on b4, then b4 can't be on b3. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the initial has:

(on b4 b3) → so b4 is on b3.

(on b10 b4) → so b10 is on b4.

But then, the stack here is b10 on b4 on b3 (table). But then, the initial also says on b7 b10. So b7 is on b10. Then, on b8 b7 → b8 on b7. And on b6 b8 → b6 on b8. So the stack here is b6 on b8 on b7 on b10 on b4 on b3 (table). But wait, that's a tall stack. But the clear predicates list clear b6. So the top of that stack is b6, which is clear. So that's correct.

Then, b5 is on b9 (on-table b9). So stack: b5 on b9 (table). Clear b5, so nothing on top of it.

So the initial state has the following stacks:

1. [b1, b2] (table)
2. [b6, b8, b7, b10, b4, b3] (table)
3. [b5, b9] (table)

Wait, but wait, the initial says on b7 b10. So b7 is on b10. Then b8 is on b7, and b6 is on b8. So the stack from bottom up is b3 (table), b4, b10, b7, b8, b6. Then, the clear blocks are b1, b5, b6. That makes sense because those are the top blocks of their stacks.

Now, the goal is:

(on b1 b5)
(on b4 b3)
(on b5 b4)
(on b6 b9)
(on b7 b10)
(on b9 b2)

So the desired configuration is:

- b9 is on b2 (table), then b6 on b9.
- b3 is on table, b4 on b3, then b5 on b4, then b1 on b5.
- b10 is on table, b7 on b10.
- Also, the goal requires on b9 b2, so b9 must be moved from its initial position (on table) to be on b2. But initially, b2 has b1 on top. So we need to move b1 first.

So the main steps would involve:

1. Moving b1 from b2 to b5. But first, we need to get b5 to be on top of b4, which is on b3. But currently, b5 is on b9. So we need to move b5 to b4, then put b1 on b5.

2. Moving b6 from its current stack (on b8) to b9. But initially, b9 is on the table with b5 on it. So first, we need to move b5 off b9. Then, after moving b5, place b6 on b9.

3. Ensure that b7 is on b10. Currently, in the initial state, b7 is on b10, so that's already satisfied. So that part is okay.

Wait, the initial state says on b7 b10. So the goal condition (on b7 b10) is already met. So no action needed there.

But wait, the initial state's stack for b7 is part of the larger stack. Let me check again. The initial stack is b6 on b8 on b7 on b10 on b4 on b3. So in the initial state, b7 is on b10. So the goal (on b7 b10) is already true. So that's one condition satisfied.

The goal (on b9 b2) requires that b9 is on b2. Currently, b9 is on the table. So we need to move b9 from the table to b2. But initially, b2 has b1 on top. So first, we need to unstack b1 from b2, put it somewhere else, then move b9 to b2.

So the steps would involve:

- Unstack b1 from b2 and put it down. Then, unstack b5 from b9 (since b5 is on b9 in the initial state) and stack it on b4. Then stack b1 on b5. Then stack b9 on b2. Then stack b6 on b9.

But let's break it down.

First, let's look at the goal conditions:

- (on b1 b5): So b1 must be on top of b5.

- (on b5 b4): So b5 must be on top of b4.

- (on b4 b3): Already true in the initial state. So that's already satisfied.

- (on b6 b9): Currently, b6 is on b8. So need to move b6 to b9.

- (on b9 b2): Currently, b9 is on the table. So need to move b9 to b2.

- (on b7 b10): Already true.

So the main steps are:

1. Move b1 from b2 to b5. But to do that, b5 must be on top of b4. So first, we need to move b5 from b9 to b4.

2. Move b9 from the table to b2. But to do that, b2 must be clear. Currently, b2 has b1 on it. So first, move b1 off b2.

3. Move b6 from its current position (on b8) to b9. But after moving b9 to b2, b9 will be under b6. Wait, no. The goal is (on b6 b9). So after moving b9 to b2, we can stack b6 on b9.

But let's outline the steps:

First, handle the b1, b5, b4, b3 part.

Current state for b5: on b9 (table). So to get b5 on b4, we need to pick up b5 and stack it on b4. But b5 is clear (since initial clear b5). So we can pick it up.

But wait, the initial clear predicates are clear b1, b5, b6. So b5 is clear. So we can do:

Action: pickup b5. Preconditions: clear(b5), on-table(b5), arm-empty. Wait, but in the initial state, b5 is on b9, not on the table. Wait, the initial says (on b5 b9). So b5 is on b9, not on the table. So the on-table(b5) is false. Therefore, the pickup action can't be used here. Because the pickup action requires that the block is on the table. So to pick up a block that's on another block, we need to unstack it.

Ah, right. So for blocks that are on top of others, we need to use the unstack action. So to get b5 off b9, we need to unstack b5 from b9. But wait, the unstack action requires that the block is on another block, and that the arm is empty, and the block is clear.

In the initial state, b5 is on b9, and clear(b5) is true. So we can unstack b5 from b9.

So first action: unstack b5 b9. Preconditions: on(b5, b9), clear(b5), arm-empty. All are satisfied. After unstacking, we are holding b5, and b9 becomes clear.

Then, we need to stack b5 on b4. But b4 is currently under b10. Wait, initial state: b4 is on b3, and b10 is on b4. So the stack is b10 on b4 on b3. So to stack b5 on b4, we need to have b4 clear. But currently, b10 is on b4. So we need to move b10 first.

Wait, this complicates things. Because the initial stack for b4 is part of a larger stack: b6 on b8 on b7 on b10 on b4 on b3. So to get b4 clear, we need to unstack all the blocks above it. That's a problem. Because the goal requires that b4 remains on b3, and that b5 is on b4, and b1 on b5. So the current stack on top of b4 (b10, then b7, then b8, then b6) needs to be moved elsewhere.

But the goal also requires that b7 is on b10, which is already the case. So perhaps we need to preserve that part. Wait, the goal says (on b7 b10), which is already true. But in the initial state, b7 is on b10, which is part of the stack. So if we move b10, we might break that. Wait, but the goal requires that b7 is on b10. So as long as after all actions, b7 is placed back on b10, that's okay. But in the initial state, b7 is on b10, but there's a stack above (b8 and b6). So perhaps we need to disassemble that stack.

Alternatively, maybe the goal doesn't require the entire stack to be preserved, just that b7 is on b10, regardless of what's above. So even if we move b8 and b6, as long as b7 remains on b10, that's okay.

So the plan would involve:

1. Unstack the blocks above b10 (b7, b8, b6) to get to b10, then move b10 so that we can access b4.

Wait, but the goal requires that b7 is on b10. So we can't move b7 from b10. So we need to leave b7 on b10. Therefore, the stack above b7 (b8 and b6) must be moved elsewhere.

So the steps would be:

- Unstack b6 from b8. Then put it down. Then unstack b8 from b7. Then put it down. Then, we have b7 on b10, which is part of the goal. Then, we can proceed to move b10 from b4, but wait, the goal requires that b4 is on b3 (which it already is), and that b5 is on b4, and b1 on b5. So to stack b5 on b4, we need to have b4 clear. But currently, b10 is on b4. So we need to move b10.

But the goal doesn't mention b10's position except that b7 is on it. So if we move b10, but then put it back under b7, that's okay. Wait, but the initial state has b10 on b4. The goal doesn't specify where b10 is, except that b7 is on it. So perhaps we can move b10 to the table, then put b7 back on it. But that's already the case. Wait, no. The initial state has b10 on b4, and b7 on b10. The goal requires that b7 is on b10. So if we move b10 to the table, then place b7 on it, that's acceptable. But in the initial state, b10 is on b4. So to move b10, we need to unstack it from b4. But to do that, we need to unstack all the blocks above it: b7, b8, b6.

Wait, the stack is b6 on b8 on b7 on b10 on b4 on b3. So to get to b10, we need to unstack b6, then b8, then b7. Then, we can unstack b10 from b4.

But the goal requires that b7 is on b10. So after moving b7, we need to put it back on b10. So perhaps:

- Unstack b6 from b8. Put it down.

- Unstack b8 from b7. Put it down.

- Now, b7 is on b10. We can leave it there as per the goal.

- Then, unstack b10 from b4. But wait, after unstacking b7 from b10, but no, in the initial state, b7 is on b10. So to unstack b10 from b4, we need to first unstack b7 from b10. But that would require moving b7. But the goal requires that b7 is on b10. So this is a problem. Because if we move b7, we have to put it back on b10. So perhaps the approach is:

1. Unstack b6 from b8. Put it down.

2. Unstack b8 from b7. Put it down.

3. Now, b7 is on b10. We need to keep it there. So we can't move b7. Therefore, we can't unstack b10 from b4 because b7 is on top of it. So this is a dead end.

Hmm, this complicates things. Let's think again.

The goal requires that b7 is on b10. So we can't move b7 from b10. Therefore, the stack of b7 on b10 must remain. But in the initial state, there's more blocks on top of b7 (b8 and b6). So to satisfy the goal, we need to remove those blocks (b8 and b6) and place them elsewhere. But the goal doesn't mention b8, so they can be placed on the table or other blocks as long as the goal conditions are met.

So steps for that part:

- Unstack b6 from b8. Preconditions: clear(b6), arm-empty, on(b6, b8). Clear(b6) is true. So unstack b6 from b8. Then put it down (putdown b6) to have it on the table. Or maybe stack it somewhere else.

Wait, the goal requires (on b6 b9). So after moving b6, we need to place it on b9. But b9 is currently under b5. So first, we need to move b5 off b9.

So the plan might look like:

1. Unstack b5 from b9. Since b5 is on b9 and clear, we can unstack it.

   - Action: unstack b5 b9. Pre: on(b5, b9), clear(b5), arm-empty. All true.

   - Effect: holding(b5), clear(b9), not on(b5, b9), etc.

2. Then, put b5 down (putdown b5) to have it on the table. Wait, but we need to stack b5 on b4. So maybe instead of putting it down, we need to stack it on b4. But to stack on b4, we need to have b4 clear. But currently, b4 is under b10, which is under b7, which is under b8 and b6. So that's not possible yet.

Alternatively, after unstacking b5 from b9, we can hold it and then proceed to unstack the blocks above b4.

But this seems complicated. Let's try to outline the steps in order.

First, handle the b1 and b9 part.

The goal requires that b9 is on b2. Currently, b2 has b1 on top. So to place b9 on b2, we need to clear b2. So first, move b1 from b2 to somewhere else.

Action: unstack b1 from b2. Preconditions: on(b1, b2), clear(b1), arm-empty. All true. After unstacking, we are holding b1. Then, we can put it down (putdown) or stack it elsewhere. But the goal requires b1 to be on b5. So we need to eventually stack it on b5. But first, we need to have b5 in the correct position.

So after moving b1, we can put it down temporarily.

Then, move b9 to b2. Since b9 is on the table and clear (after moving b5 off it), we can pick it up and stack it on b2.

Wait, after unstacking b5 from b9, b9 becomes clear. So then, we can pick up b9 and stack it on b2. But to stack on b2, b2 must be clear. But after moving b1, b2 is clear. So steps:

1. Unstack b1 from b2. Now holding b1. Put it down (putdown b1). Now b1 is on the table.

2. Unstack b5 from b9. Now holding b5. Need to stack it on b4. But b4 is under b10, which is under b7, etc. So need to clear b4.

To clear b4, we need to move b10. But b10 is under b7, which is under b8 and b6. So steps to clear b4:

3. Unstack b6 from b8. Now holding b6. Put it down (putdown b6).

4. Unstack b8 from b7. Now holding b8. Put it down.

5. Now, b7 is on b10. We need to keep it there. So leave it.

6. Now, unstack b10 from b4. But wait, b7 is on b10. So we can't unstack b10 unless we move b7 first. But the goal requires b7 to be on b10. So this is a problem. Therefore, we can't move b10. So how can we stack b5 on b4 if b10 is on top of b4?

This seems like a contradiction. The goal requires that b4 is on b3 (which it is), and b5 is on b4. But currently, b10 is on b4, so we need to move b10. But moving b10 would require moving b7, which is on top of it, but the goal requires b7 to be on b10. So this is a conflict.

Wait, perhaps the goal allows other blocks to be on top of b7 and b10 as long as the specified conditions are met. For example, the goal doesn't say anything about b8 or b6, so they can be placed elsewhere. But the problem is that in the initial state, b7 is on b10, and the goal requires that to remain. So if we move b7, we have to put it back on b10. But to move b10, we need to first move b7.

So here's the plan:

- Unstack b6 from b8. Put it down.

- Unstack b8 from b7. Put it down.

- Now, b7 is on b10. Unstack b7 from b10. But this would violate the goal unless we put it back. So after unstacking b7, we can put it back on b10 once we've moved b10.

But this seems complicated. Let's think:

The goal requires (on b7 b10). So after all actions, b7 must be on b10. So during the plan, we can move b7, but must put it back.

So steps:

1. Unstack b6 from b8 → putdown b6.

2. Unstack b8 from b7 → putdown b8.

3. Unstack b7 from b10 → now holding b7.

4. Now, unstack b10 from b4 → putdown b10.

5. Now, stack b7 back on b10 → stack b7 b10.

Now, b7 is back on b10, satisfying the goal. Then, we can proceed to stack b5 on b4.

But this adds several steps. Let's see:

After step 5, b10 is on the table, and b7 is on b10. Then, we can stack b5 on b4 (since b4 is now clear). But wait, after moving b10 from b4, b4 is clear. So:

6. Pickup b5 (which was put down earlier) → but wait, after step 1, we unstacked b5 from b9 and are holding it. Wait, no. Let's re-examine the steps.

Wait, earlier steps were:

After unstacking b1 from b2 and putting it down, then unstacking b5 from b9. So after unstacking b5 from b9, we are holding b5. Then, we need to stack it on b4. But to do that, we need to clear b4. So perhaps after unstacking b5, we need to put it down temporarily, then proceed to clear b4.

But this is getting very involved. Let's try to outline the entire plan step by step.

Let me try to list the required actions in order:

1. Unstack b1 from b2. Pre: on(b1, b2), clear(b1), arm-empty. All true. Effect: holding(b1), clear(b2), not on(b1, b2), etc.

   - Then, putdown b1. Now b1 is on the table.

2. Unstack b5 from b9. Pre: on(b5, b9), clear(b5), arm-empty. All true. Effect: holding(b5), clear(b9).

3. Now, need to stack b5 on b4. But b4 is under b10. So need to clear b4 by moving b10.

   To move b10, need to unstack the blocks above it: b7, b8, b6.

   So:

   a. Unstack b6 from b8. Pre: on(b6, b8), clear(b6), arm-empty. True. Effect: holding(b6), clear(b8).

   b. Putdown b6. Now b6 is on the table.

   c. Unstack b8 from b7. Pre: on(b8, b7), clear(b8), arm-empty. True. Effect: holding(b8), clear(b7).

   d. Putdown b8. Now b8 is on the table.

   e. Unstack b7 from b10. Pre: on(b7, b10), clear(b7), arm-empty. True. Effect: holding(b7), clear(b10).

   f. Putdown b7. Now b7 is on the table.

   g. Unstack b10 from b4. Pre: on(b10, b4), clear(b10), arm-empty. True. Effect: holding(b10), clear(b4).

   h. Putdown b10. Now b10 is on the table.

4. Now, stack b5 on b4. Pre: clear(b4), holding(b5). So action: stack b5 b4. Effect: on(b5, b4), arm-empty, clear(b5), not holding(b5), not clear(b4).

5. Now, stack b1 on b5. Pre: clear(b5), holding(b1). But currently, we are holding b10 after step 3g. Wait, no. Let's retrace.

Wait, after step 3g, we unstack b10 from b4 and are holding b10. Then step 3h is putdown b10. So after that, arm is empty. Then, we need to pick up b5 again. Wait, no. After step 2, we unstacked b5 from b9 and are holding it. Then, steps 3a to 3h involve putting down b5? No, no. Wait, after step 2, we are holding b5. Then, to proceed to steps 3a (unstack b6 from b8), we need to put down b5 first, because the arm is holding b5. So this is a problem. Because after step 2, we are holding b5. To perform any other action, we need to put it down first. So perhaps:

After step 2 (unstack b5 from b9), we need to putdown b5. Then proceed to clear the blocks above b4.

But then, after clearing b4, we need to pick up b5 again to stack it on b4.

So revised steps:

1. Unstack b1 from b2 → putdown b1.

2. Unstack b5 from b9 → putdown b5.

3. Now, clear the blocks above b4:

   a. Unstack b6 from b8 → putdown b6.

   b. Unstack b8 from b7 → putdown b8.

   c. Unstack b7 from b10 → putdown b7.

   d. Unstack b10 from b4 → putdown b10.

4. Now, pick up b5 (on table) → pickup b5. Pre: clear(b5), on-table(b5), arm-empty. After step 2, b5 is on the table and clear (since we put it down). So yes.

5. Stack b5 on b4 → stack b5 b4.

6. Now, pick up b1 (on table) → pickup b1. Pre: clear(b1), on-table(b1), arm-empty. Yes.

7. Stack b1 on b5 → stack b1 b5.

Now, the next goal is to get b9 on b2. Currently, b9 is on the table (after step 2, we unstacked b5 from b9, so b9 is clear and on table). So:

8. Pickup b9 → pickup b9. Pre: clear(b9), on-table(b9), arm-empty. After step 2, b9 is clear and on table. Yes.

9. Stack b9 on b2 → stack b9 b2. Pre: clear(b2), holding(b9). After step 1, b2 is clear. Yes.

Now, the goal requires b6 to be on b9. So:

10. Pickup b6 (on table from step 3a) → pickup b6.

11. Stack b6 on b9 → stack b6 b9. Pre: clear(b9), holding(b6). After step 9, b9 is under b2 (no, wait, after step 9, b9 is stacked on b2. So the stack is b9 on b2. So clear(b9) is true. So yes.

Now, the goal also requires that b7 is on b10. Currently, after step 3c, b7 is on the table. So we need to move b7 back onto b10.

12. Pickup b7 → pickup b7. Pre: clear(b7), on-table(b7), arm-empty. Yes.

13. Stack b7 on b10 → stack b7 b10. Pre: clear(b10), holding(b7). After step 3d, b10 is on the table. So clear(b10) is true. Yes.

Now, check the goal conditions:

- (on b1 b5): Yes, step 7.

- (on b5 b4): Yes, step 5.

- (on b4 b3): Already true in initial and not moved.

- (on b6 b9): Yes, step 11.

- (on b9 b2): Yes, step 9.

- (on b7 b10): Yes, step 13.

But wait, after step 3d, we putdown b10. So b10 is on the table. Then, in step 13, we stack b7 on b10. So b10 is on the table, and b7 is on it. That's acceptable. The goal doesn't require b10 to be on anything else, just that b7 is on it.

So this seems to cover all the goals.

Now, let's verify each action's preconditions and effects.

Let's list all the actions in order:

1. unstack b1 b2 → pre: on(b1,b2), clear(b1), arm-empty. All true. After: holding(b1), clear(b2), not on(b1,b2), etc.

2. putdown b1 → pre: holding(b1). Yes. After: on-table(b1), clear(b1), arm-empty.

3. unstack b5 b9 → pre: on(b5,b9), clear(b5), arm-empty. Yes. After: holding(b5), clear(b9).

4. putdown b5 → pre: holding(b5). Yes. After: on-table(b5), clear(b5), arm-empty.

5. unstack b6 b8 → pre: on(b6,b8), clear(b6), arm-empty. Yes. After: holding(b6), clear(b8).

6. putdown b6 → pre: holding(b6). Yes. After: on-table(b6), clear(b6), arm-empty.

7. unstack b8 b7 → pre: on(b8,b7), clear(b8), arm-empty. Yes. After: holding(b8), clear(b7).

8. putdown b8 → pre: holding(b8). Yes. After: on-table(b8), clear(b8), arm-empty.

9. unstack b7 b10 → pre: on(b7,b10), clear(b7), arm-empty. Yes. After: holding(b7), clear(b10).

10. putdown b7 → pre: holding(b7). Yes. After: on-table(b7), clear(b7), arm-empty.

11. unstack b10 b4 → pre: on(b10,b4), clear(b10), arm-empty. Yes. After: holding(b10), clear(b4).

12. putdown b10 → pre: holding(b10). Yes. After: on-table(b10), clear(b10), arm-empty.

13. pickup b5 → pre: clear(b5), on-table(b5), arm-empty. Yes. After: holding(b5), not clear(b5), etc.

14. stack b5 b4 → pre: clear(b4), holding(b5). Yes. After: on(b5,b4), arm-empty, clear(b5), not clear(b4).

15. pickup b1 → pre: clear(b1), on-table(b1), arm-empty. Yes. After: holding(b1), etc.

16. stack b1 b5 → pre: clear(b5), holding(b1). Yes. After: on(b1,b5), arm-empty, clear(b1), not clear(b5).

17. pickup b9 → pre: clear(b9), on-table(b9), arm-empty. Yes. After: holding(b9), etc.

18. stack b9 b2 → pre: clear(b2), holding(b9). Yes. After: on(b9,b2), arm-empty, clear(b9), not clear(b2).

19. pickup b6 → pre: clear(b6), on-table(b6), arm-empty. Yes. After: holding(b6), etc.

20. stack b6 b9 → pre: clear(b9), holding(b6). Yes. After: on(b6,b9), arm-empty, clear(b6), not clear(b9).

21. pickup b7 → pre: clear(b7), on-table(b7), arm-empty. Yes. After: holding(b7), etc.

22. stack b7 b10 → pre: clear(b10), holding(b7). Yes. After: on(b7,b10), arm-empty, clear(b7), not clear(b10).

Now, check if all preconditions are met at each step.

Yes, this seems to work. Now, let's verify the final state:

- b1 is on b5, which is on b4, which is on b3.

- b9 is on b2, with b6 on b9.

- b7 is on b10, which is on the table.

All other blocks (b8, b3, b10, b2, etc.) are in positions that don't conflict with the goal.

So the plan should be the sequence of actions as listed above. But let's count the steps. The actions are numbered 1 to 22, but each action is a single step. So the plan would have 22 actions. But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let's see.

Wait, after step 3 (unstack b5 from b9 and putdown), then steps 5-12 are clearing the blocks above b4. Then steps 13-22 are building the desired stacks. But maybe there's a more efficient way.

Alternatively, perhaps after unstacking b5 from b9, instead of putting it down, we can hold it while clearing the blocks above b4. But that's not possible because the arm can only hold one block at a time. So we need to put down b5 to free the arm to unstack other blocks.

So the plan as outlined is necessary.

Now, let's write the plan in the required format, listing each action in order.

The final plan would be:

(unstack b1 b2)
(putdown b1)
(unstack b5 b9)
(putdown b5)
(unstack b6 b8)
(putdown b6)
(unstack b8 b7)
(putdown b8)
(unstack b7 b10)
(putdown b7)
(unstack b10 b4)
(putdown b10)
(pickup b5)
(stack b5 b4)
(pickup b1)
(stack b1 b5)
(pickup b9)
(stack b9 b2)
(pickup b6)
(stack b6 b9)
(pickup b7)
(stack b7 b10)

Now, let's verify each step's preconditions:

- After unstack b1 b2, arm is holding b1. Then putdown b1: correct.

- Then unstack b5 b9: possible because b5 is on b9 and clear, arm is empty.

- Putdown b5: correct.

- Then unstack b6 from b8: possible because b6 is clear, arm empty.

- Putdown b6.

- Unstack b8 from b7: possible.

- Putdown b8.

- Unstack b7 from b10: possible.

- Putdown b7.

- Unstack b10 from b4: possible.

- Putdown b10.

- Pickup b5: now b5 is on table and clear.

- Stack b5 on b4: b4 is clear.

- Pickup b1: on table and clear.

- Stack b1 on b5: correct.

- Pickup b9: on table and clear.

- Stack b9 on b2: b2 is clear.

- Pickup b6: on table and clear.

- Stack b6 on b9: correct.

- Pickup b7: on table and clear.

- Stack b7 on b10: correct.

Yes, this should work. All preconditions are met at each step.
