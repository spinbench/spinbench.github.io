Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. 

Starting with the initial state analysis. The objects are blocks b1 to b6. From the initial conditions:

- b3 is on b1, which is on b4 (on-table). So the stack is b3 -> b1 -> b4 (table).
- b2 is on b5, which is on b6 (on-table). So stack is b2 -> b5 -> b6 (table).
- Clear blocks are b2 and b3 because nothing is on top of them. The arm is empty.

Available actions are pickup, putdown, stack, unstack. Let's check their preconditions. For example, to pickup a block, it must be clear, on the table, and the arm empty. But looking at the initial state, b3 is clear but it's on b1, not the table. So can't pick up b3 directly. Similarly, b2 is on b5, so not on the table. So the only blocks on the table are b4 and b6. But b4 has b1 on it, so it's not clear. b6 has b5 on it. So initially, the only clear blocks on the table are none. Wait, wait. Wait, the initial state says on-table b4 and on-table b6. But b1 is on b4, so b4 is not clear. Similarly, b5 is on b6, so b6 is not clear. The clear blocks are b2 and b3. But they are not on the table. So in the initial state, there are no blocks that can be picked up because the only clear blocks are on top of other blocks, not on the table. So the only possible initial actions are unstacking. Because unstack requires a block that is on another block, clear, and arm empty. So for example, unstack b3 from b1. Because b3 is clear and on b1. So that's possible.

So the first action might be unstack b3 from b1. Let's see. That would give us holding b3, clear b1, and remove on(b3, b1). Then, maybe we can put it down or stack it elsewhere.

Now, looking at the goal: on b3 b6, on b5 b2, on b6 b5. So the desired stacks are:

- b3 on b6
- b6 on b5
- b5 on b2

But wait, the goal says (on b6 b5), so b6 is on top of b5. But in the initial state, b5 is on b6. So we need to reverse that. Also, b5 needs to be on b2. So the current stack of b2 on b5 needs to be reversed. So first, we need to disassemble the existing stacks.

Let's outline the steps needed:

1. Get b3 to b6. Currently, b3 is on b1. So need to unstack b3 from b1, then stack it on b6. But first, b6 is under b5. So we need to move b5 and b2 to get b6 clear.

2. The goal requires b5 to be on b2. Currently, b2 is on b5. So we need to move b2 off b5 first. Then place b5 on b2.

3. Also, b6 needs to be on b5. So after moving b5 to b2, we need to place b6 on b5.

But let's break this down step by step.

First, let's handle the b3 part. To get b3 on b6, we need to have b6 clear. But initially, b6 has b5 on it. So we need to move b5. But b5 is under b2. So first, we need to unstack b2 from b5. Then put b2 down. Then move b5 to somewhere else so that b6 is clear. Then stack b3 on b6.

Wait, but the goal also requires b5 to be on b2. So after moving b2 and b5, we need to stack b5 on b2, then stack b6 on b5, then stack b3 on b6.

But let's think about the order. Let's see:

Goal conditions:

- on b3 b6
- on b5 b2
- on b6 b5

So the stack for b3 is on top of b6, which is on top of b5, which is on top of b2. So the order is b3 -> b6 -> b5 -> b2. But the initial state has b2 on b5, which is on b6. So we need to reverse that.

So steps needed:

1. Unstack b2 from b5. Then put it down. Now, b5 is clear and on b6. Then unstack b5 from b6 and put it down. Then stack b5 on b2. Then stack b6 on b5. Then stack b3 on b6.

But wait, after moving b2 and b5, we need to arrange them in the correct order. Let's outline:

- Unstack b2 from b5. Preconditions: b2 is clear (it is), on b2 b5, arm empty. So unstack b2 b5. Then putdown b2. Now, b2 is on the table, clear. Then unstack b5 from b6 (since after moving b2, b5 is on b6 and clear). Then stack b5 on b2. Now, b5 is on b2. Then stack b6 on b5. But wait, b6 is on the table. So first, we need to pick up b6. But initially, b6 is under b5. So after moving b5, b6 is on the table and clear. So we can pick up b6 and stack it on b5. Then, stack b3 on b6.

But also, we need to handle the initial stack of b3 on b1. Let's see:

Original stack: b3 on b1, which is on b4. So to get b3 to b6, we need to unstack b3 from b1. Then, perhaps put it down temporarily, but eventually stack it on b6.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, let's handle the b2 and b5 part.

Initial steps:

1. Unstack b2 from b5. This requires that b2 is clear (it is), on b2 b5, and arm empty. So action: unstack b2 b5. Effects: holding b2, clear b5, not on b2 b5, not clear b2, not arm empty.

Then, putdown b2. Now, b2 is on the table, clear. Arm is empty.

2. Now, unstack b5 from b6. Because after step 1, b5 is on b6 and clear. So unstack b5 b6. Preconditions: on b5 b6 (yes), clear b5 (yes), arm empty (yes after putdown). So unstack b5 b6. Effects: holding b5, clear b6, not on b5 b6, etc.

Then, stack b5 on b2. To do this, need to have b2 clear (it is on the table and clear). So stack b5 b2. Preconditions: clear b2 (yes, since it's on table and nothing on it), holding b5. So stack. Effects: arm empty, clear b5, on b5 b2, not clear b2, not holding b5.

Now, b5 is on b2, which is on the table. Then, we need to stack b6 on b5. But b6 is on the table and clear (after unstacking b5 from it). So we can pick up b6 and stack it on b5.

3. Pickup b6. Wait, but pickup requires the block to be on table and clear. After step 2, b6 is on table and clear (since we unstacked b5 from it). So yes. So action: pickup b6. Preconditions: clear b6 (yes), on-table b6 (yes), arm empty (yes after stack). So pickup b6. Effects: holding b6, not clear b6 (but wait, after unstacking b5 from b6, b6 is clear. So after pickup, it's not on table anymore. So after pickup, we can stack it.

4. Stack b6 on b5. So stack b6 b5. Preconditions: clear b5 (after stacking b5 on b2, b5 is on top of b2, so clear? Wait, after stacking b5 on b2, the block b5 is on b2, so b5 is clear (since nothing is on it). So yes. So stack b6 b5. Effects: arm empty, clear b6, on b6 b5, not clear b5, not holding b6.

Now, the stack is b6 on b5, which is on b2. But the goal requires b6 to be on b5, and b5 on b2. So that's correct. Then, the next part is to get b3 on b6.

But currently, b3 is on b1, which is on b4. So we need to unstack b3 from b1. Let's proceed.

5. Unstack b3 from b1. Preconditions: on b3 b1 (yes), clear b3 (yes, since it's the top), arm empty (yes after stack). So unstack b3 b1. Effects: holding b3, clear b1, not on b3 b1, etc.

Now, we need to stack b3 on b6. But b6 is currently on b5. So to stack b3 on b6, we need to have b6 clear. But after step 4, b6 is under nothing. Wait, no. After step 4, b6 is stacked on b5. So b6 is clear. Because nothing is on top of it. So yes, we can stack b3 on b6.

6. Stack b3 b6. Preconditions: holding b3 (yes), clear b6 (yes). So stack. Effects: arm empty, clear b3, on b3 b6, not clear b6, not holding b3.

Now, check the goal conditions:

- on b3 b6: yes.
- on b5 b2: yes (from step 2).
- on b6 b5: yes (from step 4).

So all goals are met. Let's check if all actions are possible.

Let's verify each step's preconditions and effects.

1. unstack b2 b5:
   - Pre: on b2 b5 (yes), clear b2 (yes), arm-empty (yes).
   - Post: holding b2, clear b5.

2. putdown b2:
   - Pre: holding b2 (yes).
   - Post: on-table b2, clear b2, arm-empty.

3. unstack b5 b6:
   - Pre: on b5 b6 (yes), clear b5 (yes, after step 1, b5 is clear), arm-empty (yes after putdown).
   - Post: holding b5, clear b6.

4. stack b5 b2:
   - Pre: holding b5 (yes), clear b2 (yes, after putdown, b2 is on table and clear).
   - Post: on b5 b2, clear b5, arm-empty.

5. pickup b6:
   - Pre: on-table b6 (yes), clear b6 (yes, after unstacking b5), arm-empty (yes after stack).
   - Post: holding b6.

6. stack b6 b5:
   - Pre: holding b6 (yes), clear b5 (yes, after stacking b5 on b2, it's clear).
   - Post: on b6 b5, clear b6, arm-empty.

7. unstack b3 b1:
   - Pre: on b3 b1 (yes), clear b3 (yes), arm-empty (yes after stack).
   - Post: holding b3, clear b1.

8. stack b3 b6:
   - Pre: holding b3 (yes), clear b6 (yes, after stacking b6 on b5, it's clear).
   - Post: on b3 b6, clear b3, arm-empty.

Wait, but after step 6 (stack b6 on b5), the clear status of b6 is now not clear, because something (b3) is going to be stacked on it. Wait, no. After step 6, stack b6 on b5. Then, b6 is on top of b5. So b6 is clear. Then, when we stack b3 on b6, we need to have clear b6. Which is true. So step 8's preconditions are met.

So the plan would be:

(unstack b2 b5)
(putdown b2)
(unstack b5 b6)
(stack b5 b2)
(pickup b6)
(stack b6 b5)
(unstack b3 b1)
(stack b3 b6)

Wait, but after step 6 (stack b6 b5), the next action is unstack b3 from b1. Let's check the state after step 6.

After step 6:

- b5 is on b2 (on-table)
- b6 is on b5 (so b5 is not clear)
- b3 is on b1 (on b4)
- b2 is on table (from step 2)
- b4 is on table with b1 on it
- b6 is on b5, so clear (since nothing is on b6)
- arm is empty after stack b6.

So unstack b3 from b1 is possible because b3 is clear, on b1, and arm is empty. Then stack b3 on b6 (which is clear).

Yes, that works.

So the final plan is the sequence of these eight actions. Let me check again for any missing steps or errors.

Wait, after step 4 (stack b5 on b2), b5 is on b2. Then, step 5 is pickup b6. But after step 3 (unstack b5 from b6), b6 is on table and clear. So yes, pickup b6 is possible.

Then stack b6 on b5 (step 6). Now, b6 is on b5, which is on b2. Then, unstack b3 from b1 (step7), then stack on b6 (step8). All correct.

So the plan should be:

1. unstack b2 b5
2. putdown b2
3. unstack b5 b6
4. stack b5 b2
5. pickup b6
6. stack b6 b5
7. unstack b3 b1
8. stack b3 b6

Yes, that should achieve all the goals. Let's verify the goal conditions:

- on b3 b6: yes (step8)
- on b5 b2: yes (step4)
- on b6 b5: yes (step6)

All goals are met. Now, check if each action's preconditions are met when executed.

Let's simulate step by step:

Initial state:

- on b1 b4, on-table b4
- on b2 b5, on b5 b6, on-table b6
- on b3 b1
- clear b2, clear b3
- arm-empty

After step1: unstack b2 b5

State:

- holding b2
- clear b5
- on b5 b6
- on b3 b1, on b1 b4
- on-table b4, b6
- clear b3, b5

After step2: putdown b2

- on-table b2, clear b2
- arm-empty
- on b5 b6, clear b5
- etc.

Step3: unstack b5 b6

- holding b5
- clear b6
- on-table b6
- on b2 (table), clear b2

Step4: stack b5 b2

- on b5 b2
- clear b5
- arm-empty

Step5: pickup b6 (on-table, clear)

- holding b6

Step6: stack b6 b5

- on b6 b5
- clear b6
- arm-empty

Step7: unstack b3 b1

- holding b3
- clear b1

Step8: stack b3 b6

- on b3 b6
- clear b3
- arm-empty

Yes, all steps are valid. The final state meets all the goals.
