Reasoning:
1. Initial State Analysis:
   • Objects: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10.
   • Initially, the towers are as follows:
     – Tower A: b2 is on the table with b1 on b2. (clear: b1)
     – Tower B: b3 is on the table; b4 is on b3; b10 is on b4; b7 is on b10; b8 is on b7; b6 is on b8. (clear: b6)
     – Tower C: b9 is on the table with b5 on b9. (clear: b5)
   • The available actions are:
     • pickup ?ob 
         – Preconditions: (clear ?ob), (on-table ?ob), (arm-empty)
     • putdown ?ob 
         – Preconditions: (holding ?ob)
     • stack ?ob ?underob 
         – Preconditions: (holding ?ob), (clear ?underob)
     • unstack ?ob ?underob 
         – Preconditions: (on ?ob ?underob), (clear ?ob), (arm-empty)

2. Goal State Analysis:
   • Goal conditions:
         (on b1 b5)
         (on b4 b3)
         (on b5 b4)
         (on b6 b9)
         (on b7 b10)
         (on b9 b2)
   • Gaps:
         – In Tower A, b1 currently sits on b2 but must be on b5; b5, which is on b9, must be moved to b4 (with b4 already on b3).
         – In Tower B, b4 is covered by a sub‐stack (b10, b7, b8, b6) preventing b5 from being put on it.
         – b6 (currently in Tower B) must later be placed on b9.
         – Tower C (b9–b5) must be reconfigured so that b9 is moved on b2 and later supports b6.
         – Finally, the pair (b10, b7) from Tower B must be removed from b4 and later reassembled such that b7 sits on b10.

3. Plan Generation:
   To free b4 for use in Tower A, we remove the “excess” sub‐stack from Tower B in a top–down manner and save pieces that are needed later.
   • Steps on Tower B:
     A. Unstack b6 from b8 then put it down on the table.
         – Action: unstack(b6, b8) is chosen because b6 is clear and on b8.
         – Then: putdown(b6) to save it for later stacking on b9.
     B. Unstack b8 from b7 then put it down on the table.
         – Action: unstack(b8, b7) is chosen because after A, b8 is clear.
         – Then: putdown(b8) (b8 is not needed in the goal).
     C. Unstack b7 from b10 then put it down temporarily.
         – Action: unstack(b7, b10) is needed to free b10; although b7 will later form the (b7 on b10) pair per the goal.
         – Then: putdown(b7) so that we can eventually reassemble it.
     D. Unstack b10 from b4 then put it down on the table.
         – Action: unstack(b10, b4) removes the remaining block over b4.
         – Then: putdown(b10) so that b4 becomes clear.
   • Steps on Tower C and Tower A:
     E. Unstack b5 from b9 to free b5.
         – Action: unstack(b5, b9) is chosen since b5 is clear and on b9.
     F. Stack b5 on b4.
         – Action: stack(b5, b4) places b5 on b4 (b4 is now clear) as required by the goal (b5 on b4).
     G. Unstack b1 from b2.
         – Action: unstack(b1, b2) is chosen because b1 is clear and must be moved so that eventually it can be placed on b5.
     H. Stack b1 on b5.
         – Action: stack(b1, b5) achieves the goal (b1 on b5).
   • Steps to form the second goal tower:
     I. Pickup b9 from the table.
         – b9 is on the table and clear (since b5 was removed earlier from it), making pickup(b9) applicable.
     J. Stack b9 on b2.
         – Action: stack(b9, b2) places b9 on b2 to meet the goal (b9 on b2).
     K. Pickup b6 from the table.
         – b6, previously put down, is available.
     L. Stack b6 on b9.
         – Action: stack(b6, b9) satisfies the goal (b6 on b9).
   • Finally, to reassemble the (b7, b10) pair:
     M. Pickup b7 from the table.
         – b7 was put down earlier.
     N. Stack b7 on b10.
         – Action: stack(b7, b10) achieves the goal (b7 on b10).

4. Plan Verification:
   • During each step the action’s preconditions (like arm-empty, clear conditions, and proper location conditions) are satisfied because:
         – We always use unstack/pickup when the arm is empty and the block is clear.
         – After picking up a block, we immediately put it down or stack it so that the arm is free for subsequent actions.
         – The removal of the unwanted sub‐stack from Tower B frees b4 so that b5 can be correctly placed.
         – The later pickup and stacking of blocks b9, b6, and the reassembly of b7 on b10 meet their respective goal conditions.
   • Finally, after the plan’s execution:
         – Tower A becomes: b3 (on-table) with b4 on b3, then b5 on b4, and then b1 on b5.
         – A new tower is formed with b2 as the base: b2, with b9 on b2, and then b6 on b9.
         – A separate tower is formed on the table from the removed pieces: b10 remains on the table with b7 stacked on it.
         All goal predicates are achieved.

5. Solution Output:
Below is the final plan in the required format.
