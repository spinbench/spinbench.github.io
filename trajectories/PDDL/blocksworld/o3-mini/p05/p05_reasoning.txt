Reasoning:
1. Initial State Analysis:
   - Objects: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7.
   - Initial facts:
       • (arm-empty)
       • b1 is on-table.
       • b5 is on-table.
       • b6 is on b1 and b4 is on b6 (chain A: b1 → b6 → b4, with b4 clear).
       • b3 is on b5 and b7 is on b3 and b2 is on b7 (chain B: b5 → b3 → b7 → b2, with b2 clear).
   - Available actions (pickup, putdown, stack, unstack) have preconditions that check for block clarity, whether a block is on the table or on another block, and if the robot’s arm is empty.

2. Goal State Analysis:
   - Goal conditions:
       • (on b1 b5)   → b1 must be placed on top of b5.
       • (on b2 b4)   → b2 must be on b4.
       • (on b4 b6)   → b4 must be on b6.
       • (on b5 b7)   → b5 must be placed on b7.
   - Gaps: 
       • In chain A, b1 is at the table and supporting b6. To have (on b1 b5) we must free b1 by removing its tower (b6 and b4).
       • In chain B, although b5 is on-table initially, b5 is used in a wrong stack supporting b3 and b7. We must rearrange blocks so that chain one becomes b1 on b5 on b7.
       • In chain A, the subchain b6–b4 is good for the goal (on b4 b6) and with (on b2 b4) we want b2 on b4. But currently b2 is in chain B. Thus, b2 must be removed from its original place and later repositioned onto b4.

3. Plan Generation:
   Step-by-step plan with explanation:

   • (unstack b2 b7)
     - Chosen to remove b2 from chain B so it can later be placed on b4.
     - Preconditions: (on b2 b7), (clear b2), (arm-empty) are met.
     - Effects: b2 is now held; b7 becomes clear.

   • (stack b2 b4)
     - Places b2 on b4 to begin forming the chain (b2 on b4).
     - Preconditions: holding b2 and b4 is clear.
     - Effects: (on b2 b4) holds, b2 becomes clear, and b4 is no longer clear.

   • (unstack b7 b3)
     - Removes b7 from its location in chain B so that b5 can later be placed on b7.
     - Preconditions: (on b7 b3), (clear b7) (from previous step), (arm-empty) hold.
     - Effects: b7 is held; b3 becomes clear.

   • (putdown b7)
     - Puts b7 on the table so it is available as a base to receive b5.
     - Preconditions: holding b7.
     - Effects: b7 is on-table and becomes clear.

   • (unstack b3 b5)
     - Removes b3 from b5 so that b5 becomes clear.
     - Preconditions: (on b3 b5), (clear b3), (arm-empty) hold.
     - Effects: b3 is held; b5 becomes clear.

   • (putdown b3)
     - Puts b3 on the table to free the hand and allow further moves.
     - Preconditions: holding b3.
     - Effects: b3 is on-table and clear.

   • (pickup b5)
     - Picks up b5 (which is clear and on-table) to reposition it on b7.
     - Preconditions: (clear b5), (on-table b5), (arm-empty).
     - Effects: b5 is held.

   • (stack b5 b7)
     - Stacks b5 onto b7, forming the subchain (b5 on b7), which is part of the goal (on b5 b7).
     - Preconditions: holding b5 and (clear b7).
     - Effects: (on b5 b7) is established; b5 becomes clear; b7 loses its clear status.

   For the lower tower (chain A) we now must free b1 so it may be placed on b5.
   • (unstack b2 b4)
     - We undo the placement of b2 on b4 (temporarily) to free b4. Later b2 will be re-stacked.
     - Preconditions: (on b2 b4), (clear b2), (arm-empty).
     - Effects: b2 is held; b4 becomes clear.

   • (putdown b2)
     - Puts b2 on the table so that our hand is free to work on chain A.
     - Preconditions: holding b2.
     - Effects: b2 is on-table and clear.

   • (unstack b4 b6)
     - Removes b4 (which now is clear) from b6 so that we can remove b6 from b1.
     - Preconditions: (on b4 b6), (clear b4), (arm-empty).
     - Effects: b4 is held; b6 becomes clear.

   • (putdown b4)
     - Puts b4 on the table to free the hand.
     - Preconditions: holding b4.
     - Effects: b4 is on-table and clear.

   • (unstack b6 b1)
     - Removes b6 from b1 now that b6 is clear.
     - Preconditions: (on b6 b1), (clear b6), (arm-empty).
     - Effects: b6 is held; b1 becomes clear.

   • (putdown b6)
     - Puts b6 on the table (temporarily) to get a free hand.
     - Preconditions: holding b6.
     - Effects: b6 is on-table and clear.

   • (pickup b1)
     - Picks up b1 (which is now clear and on-table) to reposition it.
     - Preconditions: (clear b1), (on-table b1), (arm-empty).
     - Effects: b1 is held.

   • (stack b1 b5)
     - Stacks b1 onto b5 to satisfy goal (on b1 b5).
     - Preconditions: holding b1 and (clear b5) (from the effect of previous stacking, b5 is clear).
     - Effects: (on b1 b5) holds; arm becomes empty.

   Finally, we must reconstruct chain two (b2 on b4 on b6):
   • (pickup b4)
     - Picks up b4 from the table so it can be placed back.
     - Preconditions: (on-table b4), (clear b4), (arm-empty).
     - Effects: b4 is held.
    
   • (stack b4 b6)
     - Stacks b4 onto b6, achieving goal (on b4 b6).
     - Preconditions: holding b4 and (clear b6).
     - Effects: (on b4 b6) holds; b4 becomes clear.
    
   • (pickup b2)
     - Picks up b2 from the table to finally place it.
     - Preconditions: (on-table b2), (clear b2), (arm-empty).
     - Effects: b2 is held.
    
   • (stack b2 b4)
     - Stacks b2 onto b4 to satisfy (on b2 b4).
     - Preconditions: holding b2 and (clear b4).
     - Effects: (on b2 b4) holds; arm becomes empty.

4. Plan Verification:
   - We simulated each action ensuring its preconditions (clear, on-table or on, arm-empty) are met.
   - The plan repositions blocks from their initial towers to form two chains:
         Chain one: (b1 on b5) and (b5 on b7).
         Chain two: (b2 on b4) and (b4 on b6).
   - All goal conditions (on b1 b5, on b2 b4, on b4 b6, on b5 b7) are reached.

5. Solution Output:
$$
