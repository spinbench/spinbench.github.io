Reasoning:
1. Initial State Analysis:
   • Objects: b1,b2,…,b12.
   • Initial facts:
  – Tower1 (Chain1): b3 is on-table; b10 on b3; b8 on b10; b1 on b8; b2 on b1; clear(b2).
  – Tower2 (Chain2): b4 on-table; b11 on b4; b12 on b11; b5 on b12; clear(b5).
  – Tower3 (Chain3): b7 on-table; b9 on b7; b6 on b9; clear(b6).
   • Available actions (pickup, putdown, stack, unstack) require conditions such as the target block being clear, on-table or on another block, and the arm being empty.

2. Goal State Analysis:
   • Goal conditions:
  – (on b1 b10)
  – (on b2 b5)
  – (on b3 b8)
  – (on b5 b6)
  – (on b6 b9)
  – (on b9 b12)
  – (on b10 b7)
  – (on b11 b4)
  – (on b12 b1)
   • Interpreting these goals:
  – Tower A (to be built by reassembling blocks from several towers) will be: base b7, then b10, then b1, then b12, then b9, then b6, then b5, then b2.
  – Tower B: base b8 with b3 on top.
  – Tower C remains: b4 (base) with b11 on top.
   • Gaps: In the initial state the blocks are distributed over three towers (chain1, chain2, chain3). Some blocks that must go to Tower A (like b10, b1, b12, etc.) are not in the desired order. Also, b8 and b3 (currently in chain1) must form Tower B. Hence several unstacking and re-stacking moves (and temporary putdowns) are needed.

3. Plan Generation:
   To build the final towers we disassemble the incorrect stacks and then reassemble them:
   • For Tower A (desired: b7, b10, b1, b12, b9, b6, b5, b2):
  – First, clear tower3’s top so that b7 becomes clear. b9 (which sits on b7) is unwanted here.
   1. Unstack b6 from b9 (because b6 is on b9 and is clear). Pre: (on b6 b9), clear(b6), arm-empty.
   2. Putdown b6 to the table.
   3. Unstack b9 from b7 (now b9 is clear because b6 was removed). Pre: (on b9 b7), clear(b9), arm-empty.
   4. Putdown b9.
  – Then, dismantle Tower1 (chain1) to free blocks for Tower A and Tower B.
   5. Unstack b2 from b1. (Pre: (on b2 b1), clear(b2))
   6. Putdown b2.
   7. Unstack b1 from b8. (Pre: (on b1 b8); note: b1 is not clear until b2 is removed)
   8. Putdown b1.
   9. Unstack b8 from b10. (Pre: (on b8 b10), clear(b8))
   10. Putdown b8. 
   11. Unstack b10 from b3. (Pre: (on b10 b3), clear(b10))
   12. Putdown b10.
   • For Tower2 (chain2) we remove blocks that must go to Tower A.
   13. Unstack b5 from b12. (Pre: (on b5 b12), clear(b5))
   14. Putdown b5.
   15. Unstack b12 from b11. (Pre: (on b12 b11), clear(b12)) 
   16. Putdown b12.
   • Now reassemble Tower A:
  – With b7 (base) still on table and clear.
   17. Pickup b10 from the table (pre: b10 is on-table and clear).
   18. Stack b10 on b7. (Pre: target b7 is clear.)
   19. Pickup b1 from table.
   20. Stack b1 on b10.
   21. Pickup b12 from table.
   22. Stack b12 on b1.
   23. Pickup b9 from table.
   24. Stack b9 on b12.
   25. Pickup b6 from table.
   26. Stack b6 on b9.
   27. Pickup b5 from table.
   28. Stack b5 on b6.
   29. Pickup b2 from table.
   30. Stack b2 on b5.
   • Reassemble Tower B:
  – Desired order: b8 as base and b3 on top.
   31. Pickup b3 from table.
   32. Stack b3 on b8.
   • Tower C (b4 with b11) is already correct from the initial state after our Tower2 disassembly.

4. Plan Verification:
   We simulate step–by–step:
   – Steps 1–4 remove b6 and b9 from Tower3 so that b7 becomes clear.
   – Steps 5–12 dismantle Tower1 so that blocks b2, b1, b8, b10 are available on table.
   – Steps 13–16 dismantle Tower2 releasing b5 and b12 (while leaving b11 on b4 intact for Tower C).
   – Steps 17–30 reassemble Tower A in the desired order ensuring that each pickup action has clear and on-table blocks and that the stack actions have a clear base.
   – Steps 31–32 reassemble Tower B correctly.
   At the end, all goal relations (on b1 b10, on b12 b1, on b9 b12, on b6 b9, on b5 b6, on b2 b5, on b10 b7, on b3 b8, on b11 b4) are satisfied.

5. Solution Output:
Below is the final plan in the required format.
