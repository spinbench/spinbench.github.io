Reasoning:
1. Initial State Analysis:
   • Objects: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6.
   • Initial predicates:
       – (arm-empty)
       – (on b1 b4) and (on-table b4)
       – (on b3 b1)
       – (on b2 b5) and (clear b2)
       – (on b5 b6) and (on-table b6)
       – (clear b3)
   • Available actions (pickup, putdown, stack, unstack) have preconditions that check for clear blocks, table support, arm-empty, or holding status.

2. Goal State Analysis:
   • Goal conditions to achieve:
       – (on b3 b6)
       – (on b5 b2)
       – (on b6 b5)
   • Gaps: 
       – b3 is initially on b1 but must be moved to b6.
       – b2 and b5 are in the reverse order (b2 on b5) compared to the goal (b5 on b2).
       – b6, which supports b5 in the initial state, must be repositioned so that b6 becomes the support for b3 and sits atop b5.

3. Plan Generation:
   Step 1: Unstack b2 from b5.
     • Reason: b2 is clear and on b5; unstacking it frees b5 so we can later rearrange it.
     • Preconditions: (on b2 b5), (clear b2), (arm-empty) – all satisfied.
     • Effects: b2 is held, b5 becomes clear, and b2 is removed from b5.
     
   Step 2: Putdown b2.
     • Reason: We want b2 available on the table to later serve as the base for b5 (goal requires (on b5 b2)).
     • Preconditions: (holding b2) – satisfied from Step 1.
     • Effects: b2 is placed on the table, becomes clear, and the arm is empty.

   Step 3: Unstack b3 from b1.
     • Reason: b3 must eventually be moved to b6; so it needs to be freed from b1.
     • Preconditions: (on b3 b1), (clear b3), (arm-empty) – satisfied.
     • Effects: b3 is held, b1 becomes clear, and b3 is removed from b1.
     
   Step 4: Putdown b3.
     • Reason: Temporarily placing b3 on the table frees the arm so that we can disassemble the block stack containing b5 and b6.
     • Preconditions: (holding b3) – satisfied.
     • Effects: b3 is placed on the table, becoming clear, and the arm is empty.
     
   Step 5: Unstack b5 from b6.
     • Reason: b5 is on b6 (with b2 previously on it) but now b5 is clear (from Step 1) and needs to be reassembled later to meet the goal order.
     • Preconditions: (on b5 b6), (clear b5), (arm-empty) – satisfied.
     • Effects: b5 is held, b6 becomes clear, and b5 is removed from b6.
     
   Step 6: Stack b5 onto b2.
     • Reason: The goal requires (on b5 b2); using b2 on the table (from Step 2) with b5 held, we stack it.
     • Preconditions: (holding b5) from Step 5 and (clear b2) – satisfied.
     • Effects: b5 becomes placed on b2, the arm becomes empty, and b2 is no longer clear while b5 becomes clear.
     
   Step 7: Pickup b6.
     • Reason: We need to later stack b6 on b5 (as per (on b6 b5)), and with b6 clear on the table (as freed in Step 5) and the arm free, we pick it up.
     • Preconditions: (clear b6), (on-table b6), (arm-empty) – satisfied.
     • Effects: b6 is held, and it is removed from the table.
     
   Step 8: Stack b6 onto b5.
     • Reason: Goal (on b6 b5) is achieved by placing b6 onto b5 which is currently on b2.
     • Preconditions: (holding b6) from Step 7 and (clear b5) – satisfied.
     • Effects: b6 is stacked on b5, the arm is freed, and b5 becomes not clear.
     
   Step 9: Pickup b3.
     • Reason: Now that b6 is free (clear from Step 8) to receive another block, we retrieve b3 (currently on the table) to place it on b6.
     • Preconditions: (clear b3), (on-table b3), (arm-empty) – satisfied.
     • Effects: b3 is held, and it is removed from table.
     
   Step 10: Stack b3 onto b6.
     • Reason: This final action meets the goal (on b3 b6) by stacking b3 on b6.
     • Preconditions: (holding b3) from Step 9 and (clear b6) – satisfied.
     • Effects: b3 is placed on b6 and the arm is freed.

4. Plan Verification:
   • We simulated each step:
       - Steps 1–2 free and reposition b2 so that it can support b5.
       - Steps 3–4 remove b3 from its undesired position.
       - Steps 5–6 dismantle and rebuild the (b5, b6) stack to allow later stacking.
       - Steps 7–8 pick up and reassemble b6 on b5.
       - Steps 9–10 finish by picking up b3 and stacking it on b6.
   • At the end of execution, all goal conditions:
       – (on b3 b6) from Step 10,
       – (on b5 b2) from Step 6,
       – (on b6 b5) from Step 8,
     are achieved.
