Reasoning:
1. Initial State Analysis:
   • Objects: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8.
   • Initial facts:
  – arm-empty.
  – b1 is on-table; b1 has b4 on it (b4 is clear).
  – b8 is on-table; on b8, b2 sits; on b2, b7 sits; on b7, b3 sits; on b3, b5 sits; on b5, b6 sits (b6 is clear).
   • Available actions (pickup, putdown, stack, unstack) require as preconditions that the block to be moved be clear and/or on-table or on another block, as well as the arm being empty.

2. Goal State Analysis:
   • Goals (each must hold in the final state):
  – (on b1 b6): b1 must be stacked on b6.
  – (on b4 b7): b4 must be on b7.
  – (on b5 b4): b5 must be on b4.
  – (on b6 b2): b6 must be on b2.
  – (on b8 b1): b8 must be on b1.
   • The desired final configuration has two chains:
  Chain1: b2 on table, then b6 on b2, then b1 on b6, with b8 on b1.
  Chain2: b7 on table, then b4 on b7, then b5 on b4.
   • Gaps: In the initial state, blocks in the b8‐tower are arranged as b8→b2→b7→b3→b5→b6 and b1→b4. To achieve the goal:
  – We must dismantle the b8–tower to free b2 (so it can be on table) and remove extra blocks (b7, b3, b5, b6) so that b6 can later be stacked on b2 and b1 on b6 and then b8 on b1.
  – We must also reassemble a second chain by moving b4 (currently on b1) into the correct location on b7 with b5 atop.
   • Each action’s preconditions (clear, on-table, arm-empty or holding) will be met step by step as we undo the unwanted stacking and rebuild the two target stacks.

3. Plan Generation:
 Step 1. (unstack b6 b5)
  • Chosen because b6 is clear and on b5, and we need to free the upper part of the b8–tower.
  • Preconditions: (on b6 b5), (clear b6), (arm-empty) are true.
  • Effect: b6 is held; b5 becomes clear.
 Step 2. (putdown b6)
  • We put b6 on table to later reposition it onto b2.
  • Preconditions: holding b6.
  • Effect: b6 is on-table and clear; arm becomes empty.
 Step 3. (unstack b5 b3)
  • With b5 clear (after step 1) and b5 on b3, remove b5 to free b3.
  • Preconditions: (on b5 b3), (clear b5), (arm-empty) hold.
  • Effect: b5 is held; b3 becomes clear.
 Step 4. (stack b5 b4)
  • In the goal chain2, eventually b5 must be on b4. We use b4 (currently on b1 and clear) as a temporary destination.
  • Preconditions: holding b5 and (clear b4) hold.
  • Effect: b5 is placed on b4; arm becomes empty; b4 becomes not clear.
 Step 5. (unstack b5 b4)
  • To free b4 from b1 later, we remove b5 from b4.
  • Preconditions: (on b5 b4), (clear b5), (arm-empty) hold.
  • Effect: b5 becomes held; b4 becomes clear.
 Step 6. (putdown b5)
  • We put b5 on table to have it free for later restacking.
  • Preconditions: holding b5.
  • Effect: b5 is on-table and clear; arm becomes empty.
 Step 7. (unstack b4 b1)
  • b4 (currently on b1) is in the wrong location for chain2. We remove it.
  • Preconditions: (on b4 b1), (clear b4), (arm-empty) hold.
  • Effect: b4 is held; b1 becomes clear.
 Step 8. (putdown b4)
  • Put b4 on table temporarily so we can later place it on b7.
  • Preconditions: holding b4.
  • Effect: b4 is on-table and clear; arm becomes empty.
 Step 9. (unstack b3 b7)
  • In the b8–tower, b3 (which sits on b7) must be removed to later free b7.
  • Preconditions: (on b3 b7), (clear b3), (arm-empty) hold.
  • Effect: b3 is held; b7 becomes clear.
 Step 10. (putdown b3)
  • We put b3 on table since it is not needed in the final goals.
  • Preconditions: holding b3.
  • Effect: b3 is on-table and clear; arm becomes empty.
 Step 11. (pickup b4)
  • Now, to rebuild chain2, we need to place b4 on b7. b4 is on table.
  • Preconditions: (on-table b4), (clear b4), (arm-empty) hold.
  • Effect: b4 is held.
 Step 12. (stack b4 b7)
  • Stack b4 on b7 as a step toward the goal.
  • Preconditions: holding b4 and (clear b7) hold.
  • Effect: b4 is on b7; arm becomes empty; b7 becomes not clear.
 Step 13. (unstack b4 b7)
  • However, since in the final configuration b7 must be on table (and b4 must later be re-stacked on b7), we must free b7 by removing b4.
  • Preconditions: (on b4 b7), (clear b4), (arm-empty) hold.
  • Effect: b4 is held; b7 becomes clear.
 Step 14. (putdown b4)
  • Put b4 on table, preparing to later stack it on the correct b7.
  • Preconditions: holding b4.
  • Effect: b4 is on-table and clear; arm becomes empty.
 Step 15. (unstack b7 b2)
  • In the original b8–tower, b7 is on b2. For chain1, b2 must ultimately be on table so we remove b7.
  • Preconditions: (on b7 b2), (clear b7), (arm-empty) hold.
  • Effect: b7 is held; b2 becomes clear.
 Step 16. (putdown b7)
  • Put b7 on table; now b7 is correctly set aside for chain2.
  • Preconditions: holding b7.
  • Effect: b7 is on-table and clear; arm becomes empty.
 Step 17. (pickup b4)
  • To reassemble chain2, pick up b4 from table.
  • Preconditions: (on-table b4), (clear b4), (arm-empty) hold.
  • Effect: b4 is held.
 Step 18. (stack b4 b7)
  • Stack b4 on b7 as required by goal (on b4 b7).
  • Preconditions: holding b4 and (clear b7) hold.
  • Effect: b4 is on b7; arm becomes empty; b7 becomes not clear.
 Step 19. (pickup b5)
  • b5, which must be on b4 according to the goal, is on table.
  • Preconditions: (on-table b5), (clear b5), (arm-empty) hold.
  • Effect: b5 is held.
 Step 20. (stack b5 b4)
  • Stack b5 on b4, achieving the chain2 goal (on b5 b4).
  • Preconditions: holding b5 and (clear b4) hold.
  • Effect: b5 is on b4; arm becomes empty; b4 becomes not clear.
 Step 21. (unstack b2 b8)
  • In chain1, b2 (which is beneath b7 in the original tower) should be on table. Remove it from b8.
  • Preconditions: (on b2 b8), (clear b2) (since b7 was removed earlier), (arm-empty) hold.
  • Effect: b2 is held; b8 becomes clear.
 Step.22. (putdown b2)
  • Place b2 on table, as needed for chain1.
  • Preconditions: holding b2.
  • Effect: b2 is on-table and clear; arm becomes empty.
 Step 23. (pickup b6)
  • b6 is on table (from step 2) and must be moved onto b2.
  • Preconditions: (on-table b6), (clear b6), (arm-empty) hold.
  • Effect: b6 is held.
 Step 24. (stack b6 b2)
  • Stack b6 on b2 to satisfy goal (on b6 b2).
  • Preconditions: holding b6 and (clear b2) hold.
  • Effect: b6 is on b2; arm becomes empty; b2 becomes not clear.
 Step 25. (pickup b1)
  • b1 is free on table (after b4 was unstacked from it) and is needed to go on b6.
  • Preconditions: (on-table b1), (clear b1), (arm-empty) hold.
  • Effect: b1 is held.
 Step 26. (stack b1 b6)
  • Place b1 on b6 to meet (on b1 b6).
  • Preconditions: holding b1 and (clear b6) hold.
  • Effect: b1 is on b6; arm becomes empty; b6 becomes not clear.
 Step 27. (pickup b8)
  • b8 is on table (left behind after b2 was unstacked) and needs to go on b1.
  • Preconditions: (on-table b8), (clear b8), (arm-empty) hold.
  • Effect: b8 is held.
 Step 28. (stack b8 b1)
  • Finally, stack b8 on b1 to satisfy (on b8 b1).
  • Preconditions: holding b8 and (clear b1) hold.
  • Effect: b8 is on b1; arm becomes empty; b1 becomes not clear.

4. Plan Verification:
   • We simulate the execution step by step:
  – Steps 1–2 free b6 from its initial position.
  – Steps 3–4 remove b5 from the middle of the b8–tower and temporarily place it on b4.
  – Steps 5–6 clear b4 by removing b5 so that b4 (currently on b1) can be reallocated.
  – Steps 7–8 remove b4 from b1.
  – Steps 9–10 remove b3 from b7, freeing b7.
  – Steps 11–12 begin rebuilding the chain for chain2 by stacking b4 on b7.
  – Steps 13–14 undo that stack so that b7 can be freed from b2.
  – Steps 15–16 remove b7 from the tower (making b7 on table) for chain2.
  – Steps 17–20 rebuild chain2 by stacking b4 on b7 and then b5 on b4.
  – Steps 21–22 remove b2 from b8 so that b2 is on table.
  – Steps 23–24 put b6 onto b2.
  – Steps 25–26 put b1 onto b6.
  – Steps 27–28 put b8 onto b1.
   • At the end, chain1 is: b2 on table, b6 on b2, b1 on b6, b8 on b1; chain2 is: b7 on table, b4 on b7, b5 on b4. All goal conditions are met.
