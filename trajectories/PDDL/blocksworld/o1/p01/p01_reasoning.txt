Reasoning:

1. Initial State Analysis:

   Objects: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10, b11, b12

   Initial facts:  
   • arm-empty  
   • on(b1, b8), on(b2, b1), on-table(b3), on-table(b4), on(b5, b12), on(b6, b9), on-table(b7), on(b8, b10), on(b9, b7), on(b10, b3), on(b11, b4), on(b12, b11)  
   • clear(b2), clear(b5), clear(b6)  

   Actions available:  
   • pickup(?ob)  
   • putdown(?ob)  
   • stack(?ob ?underob)  
   • unstack(?ob ?underob)  

   For each action, key preconditions must be satisfied.  Example:  
   – unstack(?ob ?underob) requires on(?ob ?underob), clear(?ob), arm-empty  
   – stack(?ob ?underob) requires holding(?ob), clear(?underob)  

2. Goal State Analysis:

   Goal conditions:  
   • on(b1, b10), on(b2, b5), on(b3, b8), on(b5, b6), on(b6, b9)  
   • on(b9, b12), on(b10, b7), on(b11, b4), on(b12, b1)  

   Comparing initial and goal states:
   • In the end, blocks b4 and b11 remain as they are (on(b11, b4)), which matches the goal and needs no change aside from removing b12 from b11.  
   • Nearly all other blocks must be rearranged.  
   • A straightforward approach is to systematically unstack everything (except the bottom two b4 and b11) onto the table, then re-stack in the desired configuration.  

3. Plan Generation (why each action is chosen):

   (a) Unstack everything except b4–b11:

   1. (unstack b2 b1)  
      – Preconditions: on(b2, b1), clear(b2), arm-empty (all true)  
      – Effect: holding(b2), frees b1, removes on(b2,b1)  

   2. (putdown b2)  
      – Preconditions: holding(b2)  
      – Effect: b2 on table, arm-empty  

   3. (unstack b1 b8)  
      – Preconditions: on(b1, b8), clear(b1), arm-empty  
      – Effect: holding(b1), frees b8  

   4. (putdown b1)  
      – Preconditions: holding(b1)  
      – Effect: b1 on table, arm-empty  

   5. (unstack b8 b10)  
      – Preconditions: on(b8, b10), clear(b8), arm-empty  
      – Effect: holding(b8), frees b10  

   6. (putdown b8)  
      – Preconditions: holding(b8)  
      – Effect: b8 on table, arm-empty  

   7. (unstack b10 b3)  
      – Preconditions: on(b10, b3), clear(b10), arm-empty  
      – Effect: holding(b10), frees b3  

   8. (putdown b10)  
      – Preconditions: holding(b10)  
      – Effect: b10 on table, arm-empty  

   9. (unstack b5 b12)  
      – Preconditions: on(b5, b12), clear(b5), arm-empty  
      – Effect: holding(b5), frees b12  

   10. (putdown b5)  
       – Preconditions: holding(b5)  
       – Effect: b5 on table, arm-empty  

   11. (unstack b12 b11)  
       – Preconditions: on(b12, b11), clear(b12), arm-empty  
       – Effect: holding(b12), frees b11  

   12. (putdown b12)  
       – Preconditions: holding(b12)  
       – Effect: b12 on table, arm-empty  

   13. (unstack b6 b9)  
       – Preconditions: on(b6, b9), clear(b6), arm-empty  
       – Effect: holding(b6), frees b9  

   14. (putdown b6)  
       – Preconditions: holding(b6)  
       – Effect: b6 on table, arm-empty  

   15. (unstack b9 b7)  
       – Preconditions: on(b9, b7), clear(b9), arm-empty  
       – Effect: holding(b9), frees b7  

   16. (putdown b9)  
       – Preconditions: holding(b9)  
       – Effect: b9 on table, arm-empty  

   (b) Re-stack in final order:

   Goal stacks are:  
   • b8 -> b3 (on(b3, b8))  
   • b7 -> b10 -> b1 -> b12 -> b9 -> b6 -> b5 -> b2  
   • b4 -> b11 (unchanged)  

   17. (pickup b3)  
       – Preconditions: clear(b3), on-table(b3), arm-empty  
       – Effect: holding(b3)  

   18. (stack b3 b8)  
       – Preconditions: holding(b3), clear(b8)  
       – Effect: on(b3, b8), frees arm, b3 is now on b8  

   19. (pickup b10)  
       – Preconditions: clear(b10), on-table(b10), arm-empty  
       – Effect: holding(b10)  

   20. (stack b10 b7)  
       – Preconditions: holding(b10), clear(b7)  
       – Effect: on(b10, b7), arm-empty, b10 on b7  

   21. (pickup b1)  
       – Preconditions: clear(b1), on-table(b1), arm-empty  
       – Effect: holding(b1)  

   22. (stack b1 b10)  
       – Preconditions: holding(b1), clear(b10)  
       – Effect: on(b1, b10), arm-empty  

   23. (pickup b12)  
       – Preconditions: clear(b12), on-table(b12), arm-empty  
       – Effect: holding(b12)  

   24. (stack b12 b1)  
       – Preconditions: holding(b12), clear(b1)  
       – Effect: on(b12, b1), arm-empty  

   25. (pickup b9)  
       – Preconditions: clear(b9), on-table(b9), arm-empty  
       – Effect: holding(b9)  

   26. (stack b9 b12)  
       – Preconditions: holding(b9), clear(b12)  
       – Effect: on(b9, b12), arm-empty  

   27. (pickup b6)  
       – Preconditions: clear(b6), on-table(b6), arm-empty  
       – Effect: holding(b6)  

   28. (stack b6 b9)  
       – Preconditions: holding(b6), clear(b9)  
       – Effect: on(b6, b9), arm-empty  

   29. (pickup b5)  
       – Preconditions: clear(b5), on-table(b5), arm-empty  
       – Effect: holding(b5)  

   30. (stack b5 b6)  
       – Preconditions: holding(b5), clear(b6)  
       – Effect: on(b5, b6), arm-empty  

   31. (pickup b2)  
       – Preconditions: clear(b2), on-table(b2), arm-empty  
       – Effect: holding(b2)  

   32. (stack b2 b5)  
       – Preconditions: holding(b2), clear(b5)  
       – Effect: on(b2, b5), arm-empty  

4. Plan Verification:

   – Each unstack action was legal because the block on top was clear and the robot arm was empty.  
   – Each putdown was legal because the block was being held.  
   – Each pickup was legal because the block was on the table, clear, and the arm was empty.  
   – Each stack was legal because we were holding the block and the destination block was clear.  
   – After all actions, the goal conditions on(b1,b10), on(b2,b5), on(b3,b8), on(b5,b6), on(b6,b9), on(b9,b12), on(b10,b7), on(b11,b4), on(b12,b1) are fulfilled.
