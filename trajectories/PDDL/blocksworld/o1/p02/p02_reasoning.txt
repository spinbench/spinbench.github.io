Reasoning:

1. Initial State Analysis

   • Objects and Initial Relations:
     - Blocks: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10
     - Initial “on” relations:
       (on b1 b2), (on b4 b3), (on b5 b9), (on b6 b8), (on b7 b10), (on b8 b7), (on b10 b4)
     - On-table:
       (on-table b2), (on-table b3), (on-table b9)
     - Clear blocks:
       (clear b1), (clear b5), (clear b6)
     - Arm empty:
       (arm-empty)

     From these, we see three main towers:
       • b1 → b2 → table
       • b5 → b9 → table
       • b6 → b8 → b7 → b10 → b4 → b3 → table

   • Available Actions:
     1) pickup(?ob)    : requires (clear ?ob), (on-table ?ob), (arm-empty)
     2) putdown(?ob)   : requires (holding ?ob)
     3) stack(?ob ?underob)   : requires (clear ?underob), (holding ?ob)
     4) unstack(?ob ?underob) : requires (on ?ob ?underob), (clear ?ob), (arm-empty)

2. Goal State Analysis

   Goal:  
   (and  
       (on b1 b5)  
       (on b4 b3)  
       (on b5 b4)  
       (on b6 b9)  
       (on b7 b10)  
       (on b9 b2)  
   )

   Observations:  
   - (on b4 b3) is already satisfied initially (b4 on b3). We should avoid breaking it.  
   - (on b7 b10) is also initially satisfied, but it is buried under b8 and b6, so we must temporarily move b7 (and then return it on b10).  
   - b5 must move from b9 to b4, b1 must move from b2 to b5, b9 must move from the table onto b2, and finally b6 belongs on b9.  

3. Plan Generation (Step-by-Step)

   The general idea is to free up b4 (so b5 can go on it), free up b9 (so it can go onto b2), and eventually place b6 onto b9. Meanwhile, we keep b4 on b3 intact.

   a) Free the top blocks above b4 so that b4 remains on b3:  
      1. (unstack b6 b8)  
         - Why: remove b6 (top of the tower b6→b8→b7→b10→b4) to begin freeing b4.  
         - Preconditions: (on b6 b8), (clear b6), (arm-empty) ✓  
         - Effects: now holding b6, b8 becomes clear, arm is not empty.  
      2. (putdown b6)  
         - Why: to free the arm for further unstacking.  
         - Preconditions: (holding b6) ✓  
         - Effects: b6 on the table, arm empty.  
      3. (unstack b8 b7)  
         - Why: remove b8 from b7 to free b7.  
         - Preconditions: (on b8 b7), (clear b8), (arm-empty) ✓  
         - Effects: now holding b8, b7 becomes clear.  
      4. (putdown b8)  
         - Why: again, free the arm.  
         - Preconditions: (holding b8) ✓  
         - Effects: b8 on the table, arm empty.  
      5. (unstack b7 b10)  
         - Why: remove b7 from b10 to free b10.  
         - Preconditions: (on b7 b10), (clear b7), (arm-empty) ✓  
         - Effects: now holding b7, b10 becomes clear.  
      6. (putdown b7)  
         - Why: free the arm so we can unstack b10 next.  
         - Preconditions: (holding b7) ✓  
         - Effects: b7 on the table, arm empty.  
      7. (unstack b10 b4)  
         - Why: remove b10 from b4 so b4 becomes clear for stacking b5.  
         - Preconditions: (on b10 b4), (clear b10), (arm-empty) ✓  
         - Effects: now holding b10, b4 is clear.  
      8. (putdown b10)  
         - Why: free the arm again.  
         - Preconditions: (holding b10) ✓  
         - Effects: b10 on the table, arm empty.  

   b) Move b5 onto b4 and b1 onto b5:  
      9. (unstack b5 b9)  
         - Why: b5 must leave b9 so we can eventually put b9 on b2.  
         - Preconditions: (on b5 b9), (clear b5), (arm-empty) ✓  
         - Effects: holding b5, b9 becomes clear.  
      10. (stack b5 b4)  
         - Why: place b5 on b4 (goal (on b5 b4)).  
         - Preconditions: (clear b4), (holding b5) ✓  
         - Effects: b5 on b4, arm empty.  
      11. (unstack b1 b2)  
         - Why: move b1 from b2 so it can go on b5.  
         - Preconditions: (on b1 b2), (clear b1), (arm-empty) ✓  
         - Effects: holding b1, b2 becomes clear.  
      12. (stack b1 b5)  
         - Why: achieve (on b1 b5).  
         - Preconditions: (clear b5), (holding b1) ✓  
         - Effects: b1 on b5, arm empty.  

   c) Move b9 onto b2, then b6 onto b9, and finally restore b7 onto b10:  
      13. (pickup b9)  
         - Why: we want b9 on top of b2 (goal (on b9 b2)).  
         - Preconditions: (clear b9), (on-table b9), (arm-empty) ✓  
         - Effects: holding b9, arm not empty.  
      14. (stack b9 b2)  
         - Why: achieve (on b9 b2).  
         - Preconditions: (clear b2), (holding b9) ✓  
         - Effects: b9 on b2, arm empty.  
      15. (pickup b6)  
         - Why: next we want (on b6 b9).  
         - Preconditions: (clear b6), (on-table b6), (arm-empty) ✓  
         - Effects: holding b6.  
      16. (stack b6 b9)  
         - Why: achieve (on b6 b9).  
         - Preconditions: (clear b9), (holding b6) ✓  
         - Effects: b6 on b9, arm empty.  
      17. (pickup b7)  
         - Why: final goal includes (on b7 b10).  
         - Preconditions: (clear b7), (on-table b7), (arm-empty) ✓  
         - Effects: holding b7.  
      18. (stack b7 b10)  
         - Why: satisfy (on b7 b10).  
         - Preconditions: (clear b10), (holding b7) ✓  
         - Effects: b7 on b10, arm empty.  

4. Plan Verification

   • At each unstack or pickup, the block was clear, and the arm was empty.  
   • Each putdown or stack action required holding that block.  
   • We never disrupted (on b4 b3), preserving that part of the goal.  
   • In the end, the goal conditions are all satisfied:  
     - (on b4 b3) unchanged from the start.  
     - (on b5 b4) placed in step 10.  
     - (on b1 b5) placed in step 12.  
     - (on b9 b2) placed in step 14.  
     - (on b6 b9) placed in step 16.  
     - (on b7 b10) restored in step 18.
