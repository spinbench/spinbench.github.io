Reasoning:

1) Initial State Analysis

Objects: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8  
Initial relations:  
• on-table(b1), on-table(b8)  
• on(b2, b8), on(b3, b7), on(b4, b1), on(b5, b3), on(b6, b5), on(b7, b2)  
• clear(b4), clear(b6), arm-empty  

From this, we see two main “stacks”:  
• Stack 1: b8 < b2 < b7 < b3 < b5 < b6 (top)  
• Stack 2: b1 < b4 (top)  

Available actions are pickup(?ob), putdown(?ob), stack(?ob ?underob), unstack(?ob ?underob).  
Their preconditions and effects (as given in the domain) dictate how we can move blocks and the robotic arm’s status.

2) Goal State Analysis

Goal conditions:  
(on b1 b6), (on b4 b7), (on b5 b4), (on b6 b2), (on b8 b1)

Rewriting each “on(x, y)” to emphasize that x must be on top of y:  
• b6 on b2  
• b1 on b6  
• b8 on b1  
• b4 on b7  
• b5 on b4  

Hence we want two separate final towers:  
• b2 < b6 < b1 < b8  
• b7 < b4 < b5  

The main “gaps”:  
• In the initial state, b2 is on b8, but we ultimately want b8 on b1 at the top. So we must unstack b2 from b8 to free b8.  
• b7 has b3 on top (and so on), but ultimately we want b4 on b7 and b5 on b4.  

3) Plan Generation (Step-by-step)

Below, each unstack/stack/pickup/putdown action is chosen either to free a block so it can be placed properly, or to assemble a correct final tower. Precondition checks and effects are noted to ensure validity:

a) Remove b4 from b1 to free b1  
(1) (unstack b4 b1)  ; preconditions: on(b4,b1), clear(b4), arm-empty  
(2) (putdown b4)     ; precondition: holding(b4)

b) Dismantle the tall stack b8 < b2 < b7 < b3 < b5 < b6 from the top downward  
(3) (unstack b6 b5)  
(4) (putdown b6)  
(5) (unstack b5 b3)  
(6) (putdown b5)  
(7) (unstack b3 b7)  
(8) (putdown b3)  
(9) (unstack b7 b2)  
(10) (putdown b7)

Because b2 is still on top of b8, unstack it so b8 becomes clear:  
(11) (unstack b2 b8)  
(12) (putdown b2)

c) Build the desired tower b2 < b6 < b1 < b8  
(13) (pickup b6)  
(14) (stack b6 b2)  
(15) (pickup b1)  
(16) (stack b1 b6)  
(17) (pickup b8)  
(18) (stack b8 b1)

d) Build the desired tower b7 < b4 < b5  
(19) (pickup b4)  
(20) (stack b4 b7)  
(21) (pickup b5)  
(22) (stack b5 b4)

4) Plan Verification

– Each unstack action is valid only if the block being removed is clear and the arm is empty.  
– Each pickup is valid if the block is on the table, clear, and the arm is empty.  
– Each stack is valid if we are holding the top block and the block to stack onto is clear.  
– Each putdown is valid if we are currently holding a block.  

By checking each step’s preconditions against the state produced by the previous step, all actions are correctly applicable. In the end, we achieve:  
• (on b6 b2), (on b1 b6), (on b8 b1), (on b4 b7), (on b5 b4)
