This move immediately challenges White's center control and creates an asymmetrical pawn structure. The Sicilian is statistically one of Black's best weapons against e2e4, fighting for the d4 square while maintaining flexibility. It leads to sharp, complex positions where Black has excellent winning chances. The move c7c5 also prepares for potential development of the b8 knight to c6 and creates possibilities for a queenside expansion.",
