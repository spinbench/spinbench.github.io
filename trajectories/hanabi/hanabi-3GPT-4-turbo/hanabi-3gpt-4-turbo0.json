        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "Great! Since I'm adept in Hanabi strategy, I can provide some general strategic advice to help optimize our gameplay. Below, I'll outline a few strategic points that could be useful given the general rules and objectives of the game:\n\n### 1. Efficient Use of Hints\n- **Specificity in Hints:** When you give a hint, try to make it as impactful as possible. This means ideally targeting as many cards as possible with one hint or clarifying crucial plays, like identifying all cards of a needed number or color.\n- **Prioritize**: Give hints that enable immediate plays or prevent discarding important cards. For example, if a '1' of a color that hasn’t been started yet is in someone’s hand, pointing it out can be very beneficial.\n\n### 2. Strategic Discards\n- **Safe Discards**: Try to discard cards that you are confident are not immediately needed. This can be inferred from what has already been played or by the abundance of certain numbers in the discard pile and other players' hands.\n- **Information Gain through Discarding:** Sometimes discarding can be a strategic choice to gain more information tokens, especially if you’re running low and the hints are crucial for continued play.\n\n### 3. Playing Cards\n- **Sequence Plays:** Always aim to play cards that can safely extend the existing fireworks. Playing a card that you know fits because of the hints given to you is crucial.\n- **Risk Management**: If unsure, weigh the risk of playing a potentially incorrect card against the benefit of advancing a firework, keeping in mind the number of life tokens remaining.\n\n### 4. Monitoring Progress\n- **Track Fireworks**: Keep a close eye on the progress of each firework. Knowing what has been played helps in deciding both hints and plays.\n- **Track Discards**: Pay attention to what's been discarded to understand what cards are still available in the deck or in players' hands.\n\n### 5. Endgame Scenarios\n- **Deck Exhaustion**: As the deck gets low, be more conservative with the use of life tokens and focus on securing as many points as possible before the game ends.\n- **Maximize Final Rounds**: After the deck is exhausted, make the most out of the final turns. This is when knowing exactly what cards everyone holds through efficient use of hints becomes crucial.\n\nBy applying these strategic approaches and keeping communication clear through legally allowed hints, we should be able to maximize our score in Hanabi and enjoy this challenging and fun cooperative game. Let's play with an eye towards cooperation, strategy, and a bit of caution to manage risks effectively!"

Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters.

However, Player +1 does not have any hints about the identity of their cards.\n\nTo facilitate this play, I will give a hint to Player +1 about the color of their 'W1' card.

However, discarding without any hints about your own cards risks losing a potentially valuable card.\n\n3. **Optimal Use of the Current Information Token**:\n   - Since you have only one information token left and considering the visible hands of your teammates:\n     - Player +1 has a clearly identified 'R2', which can be played immediately to advance the red firework from R1 to R2.\n     - Revealing necessary information to ensure that Player +1 knows to play 'R2' could be crucial, but they already seem to have complete information about this card.\n\n4. **Best Action—Give a Useful Hint**:\n   - There is also a 'Y2' in Player +2’s hand and the yellow firework stack is at 0. Player +2 knows it's a yellow card but might not be sure it's playable right away. Giving a hint about the rank being '2' to Player +2 will confirm its playability.\n\n**Decide on the Action**: \nThe hint about 'rank 2' to Player +2 clarifies 'Y2' as immediately playable. There's value here as it uses the last info token with the potential to immediately increase the score, and it’s safe since the identity of 'Y2' is partially known to Player +2.\n\nThus, I choose to give a rank hint to Player +2, ensuring they play 'Y2' correctly:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Ensuring Player +2 knows that 'Y2' is playable by revealing its rank, thus advancing the yellow firework safely and making effective use of the last information token.\", \"action\": 26}\n```"

'R1' is also visible, which is currently playable.\n  - Player +2: Notable cards include 'G1', which is important as it can start the G stack.\n\n## Optimal Moves:\n1. **Playing a Playable Card**:\n   - You can't confidently play any cards as there's no information on your cards.\n  \n2. **Giving a Hint**:\n   - Not an option due to the absence of info tokens.\n  \n3. **Discarding a Card**:\n   - Given no info tokens are left, discarding to gain an info token seems essential.\n   - Since your cards are entirely unknown, it is risky to discard without any knowledge. However, it's necessary to regain an information token to progress smoothly.\n\n## Potential Discard:\n- With the current knowledge, none of your cards are safer to discard over others as they are all unknown. The best strategy here is to discard what you know the least about, which in this case applies to all cards equally. For simplicity and to regain an information token for team play advantage, choosing the first card (index 0) should be reasonable.\n\n## Decision:\n- Discard the first card to regain an information token, which can then be used to provide valuable hints in the next rounds. Given that all your cards are unknown and might hold equal weight in potential, the risk is uniformly distributed among them.\n\nThe output for this decision would be:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Regain an info token to provide hints in future turns, as all cards in hand are equally unknown.\", \"action\": 0}\n```"

Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Firework Progress:**\n   - Red: 2\n   - Yellow: 0\n   - Green: 0\n   - White: 1\n   - Blue: 0\n\n2. **Your Hand:** Your 5th card is known to be yellow ('Y12345'), but no specific number hint has been given. Since the Yellow stack is at 0 and you don’t know the exact number of your Yellow card, playing it directly could be risky without further information.\n\n3. **Teammates' Hands:**\n   - Player +1's hand has a Green 'G3' and a Yellow 'Y3'. Neither are currently playable due to the current progress.\n   - Player +2's hand has a White 'W4', a Red 'R3', and a Yellow 'Y4'. All are higher numbers not ready to be played.\n   - Notable is 'G1' in Player +2's hand, which is immediately playable since the Green stack is at 0.\n\n4. **Info Tokens and Hints:** \n   - Currently, there's only 1 info token. Any hint consumes this last token, so it must be used judiciously.\n\n5. **Discarding for More Info Tokens:**\n   - Discarding a card from your hand (where all are possibilities due to little information) might be a necessity if no productive hint can be given or no play is safe. However, this consumes a turn for potential score increase.\n\n6. **Optimal Action Choice:**\n   - The best immediate option is promoting the play of 'G1' from Player +2's hand, which is crucial to start building the Green firework. Given the setup, Player +2 has no specific hints about 'G1', and thus might not be aware of the importance or identity of this card.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Action:** Reveal color 'G' to Player +2. This helps solidify the identity of 'G1', encouraging Player +2 to play it in their next turn. It's a strategic use of the last available info token to secure an additional point in fireworks without risk.\n  \n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Securing a play for the 'G1' card in Player +2's hand to start the Green firework without risk and optimizing the use of the last info token for a direct scoring opportunity.\",\n  \"action\": 17\n}\n```\n\nThis move uses the available resources to immediately facilitate a scoring opportunity, aligning with the goal of progress in fireworks formation under constrained info token conditions."

        "content": "Based on the analysis of the current game state and the cards you can see in your hand and the other players' hands, let's decide the best action:\n\n### 1. Evaluate Playable Cards\n- **Your Cards**: None of your cards have sufficient known information to guarantee a safe play, except for Card 4 (known to be yellow). Since the Yellow stack is at 0 and you have a \"Y\" hint, playing the lowest yellow, which could be \"Y1\", seems like a reasonable risk if necessary.\n\n### 2. Teammates' Cards\n- **Player +1's Cards**:\n  - \"G3\": Can be played to extend the Green stack from G1 to G2.\n  - \"B2\": Can be played to start the Blue stack.\n  - \"R1\" and \"R2\": These cards cannot advance the red stack currently at R2.\n  - \"G4\": Cannot be played yet since the green stack is only at G1.\n  \n- **Player +2's Cards**:\n  - \"W4\": Cannot be played since the white stack is at W1.\n  - \"R3\": Cannot be played since the red stack is at R2.\n  - \"Y4\": Cannot be played since the yellow stack is at Y0.\n  - \"B2\" and \"B4\": Similar to Player +1, B2 can start the Blue stack, but B4 cannot be played.\n\n### 3. Assess Discards\nWith 0 info tokens left, giving hints is not an option without discarding. However, discarding should be avoided if there are clear plays available, especially since some critical cards can be played by your teammates.\n\n### 4. Best Action\nYou are aware that Player +1 has a \"B2\" which can be immediately played to start the Blue stack. This information might not be clear to them without hints that you cannot provide due to 0 info tokens. Since you cannot give hints, and you cannot safely play a card (without taking an undue risk on Yellow which can wait), the best move would be to discard a card that is least likely to be immediately beneficial.\n\nOut of your cards:\n- Card 1, 2, 3, and 5: All have a wide range of possible identities which makes any of them equally likely to be useful or not.\n- Given no specific information about these cards, discarding one of them is equally risky. Prioritizing the retention of potential low cards needed to start stacks (like yellow), and given that no other low cards or hints are known, it is safe to discard either from the others which do not provide any lesser strategic advantage.\n\nConsidering all points, we will choose to discard Card 0 for gaining an info token. This action will help in future hint giving, which is crucial right now.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Discard chosen to regain an information token, as no clear playable cards from own hand and no available hints to assist teammates' plays.\",\n  \"action\": 0\n}\n```"

Since the green stack is only at G1, 'G3' is not currently playable. However, 'B2' and 'R1' can be played as Red is at R2 and Blue at B0.\n   - **Player +2:** Holds a 'Y4', 'B2', 'W4', which are not immediately playable. 'W4' can be played soon if 'W2' and 'W3' are played, but 'W3' has been discarded.\n   \n### Strategic Move:\n- **Priority Play:** Player +1 can immediately play 'R1' to advance the Red stack to R1. They are not aware 'R1' is playable as they have no color hint.\n- **Info Token Utilization:** With only one info token left, the most beneficial use is to allow a play that can definitely advance the game. Revealing the color red to Player +1 enables a certain play.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Reveal color 'R' to Player +1.** This ensures that they know the 'R1' is playable, effectively using the hint to secure a correct placement. This move does not directly increase our score this turn but sets up for a confirmed play on the next turn by Player +1, which is crucial given our low number of life tokens and info tokens.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Revealing color 'R' to Player +1 enables them to play 'R1', advancing the Red firework without risk of error.

        "content": "Reviewing the current state of the game and the visible hands of my teammates, here's the decision-making process:\n\n**1. Analyze Playable Cards from Teammates:**\n   - Player +1 can play the card 'R1' as our Red stack is currently at 2 and no red '1' cards have been played (the only played red cards are R2 to R5 based on the discard pile).\n   - Player +2’s 'Y4' looks like it could be played soon since Yellow stands at 0, but 'Y1' to 'Y3' need to be played first.\n\n**2. Evaluate Discard Options:**\n   - We have 0 info tokens, meaning we cannot give hints unless a discard is made. \n   - Discarding might be risky without knowing more about the cards, especially since we're low on life tokens (2 left), and incorrect plays could end the game.\n\n**3. Potential Safe Plays Based on Information:**\n   - My hands have hints for green (G) cards and a single yellow (Y) card. The visible potential identities suggest each green card could be any from G1 to G5. Given that the Green stack is at G1, playing 'G2' would be the most beneficial next step if I can assume it’s in my hand. However, without specific rank hints, this is risky.\n\nGiven the circumstances, it seems safest and potentially most beneficial to allow Player +1 to make the next crucial play by playing 'R1', which certainly advances the Red fireworks. This will be achieved by confirming to Player +1 that the ‘R1’ card is the red card needed.\n\n**Decision:**\nBased on the information and the state of our game:\n- Since no info tokens are available to give a hint directly, the best move would involve choosing a low-risk discard. Observing my own hand:\n   - Discarding from my hand may introduce a new info token and help in future rounds, but since it’s a Green card (all marked as possible G1 to G5), and we need all cards for a perfect game, it's risky.\n   - All my cards are potential candidates for future plays (G2 or higher), which might be crucial.\n\nTherefore, the best move for the long-term game strategy, given zero info tokens and visible necessary plays by another player:\n- **Plan:** Opt to discard one of my cards to gain an info token, even though it's not ideal to discard potential green cards. But knowing specifics about remaining cards in my hand could be more valuable than a blind play.\n- **Choice:** Discard the first card. The rationale for choosing Card 0 over others is arbitrary due to a lack of distinguishing information between them.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Since there are no info tokens available and all cards in my hand are potentially useful (G2 or higher needed), choosing to discard a card to regain an info token for future strategic plays or hints.

Since the green firework is only at 'G1', if any of these are 'G2', they are immediately playable. However, since you don't know the exact rank and risking a play might be dangerous with only 2 life tokens left, playing a green card without additional information is risky.\n\n2. **Teammate +1 Hand:** This player has a 'G3' visible. Since 'G2' hasn't been played yet, 'G3' cannot be played immediately. 'B2' is visible and since 'B1' has not been played, this card can’t be played yet either. 'R1' is playable as red has no fireworks yet.\n\n3. **Teammate +2 Hand:** This player’s 'Y4' and 'Y5' will need more progress on the yellow stack before they are playable. 'B2' can be playable once 'B1' is played.\n\n### Strategic Decision:\n- **Priority Action:** It's critical to get the 'R1' played by Player +1 as no red cards have been played and playing 'R1' will start the red stack.\n- **Hint Utility:** With only 1 info token left, it is critical that the hint given is used to ensure a correct and necessary play. Giving a hint to Player +1 about the red color can ensure the 'R1' gets played.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nConsidering the state of the game and the criticality of progressing the fireworks without losing more life tokens, the best action would be to hint Player +1 about their red card to guarantee the play of 'R1'.\n\n**Chosen JSON Output:**\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Ensuring the play of 'R1' by Player +1 to start the red firework, which is crucial for game progression.

        "content": "Given the detailed assessment of the game state and strategic considerations, let's proceed step by step to decide the best action:\n\n### Analyze Your Hand\n- **Green Cards in Your Hand**: You know three cards in your hand are green (positions 0, 2, and 3). The current green firework stack is at G1, so possibilities are G2, G3, G4, or G5. Without clear indication of their rank, playing any of these could be risky given only 1 life token left.\n- **Yellow Card in Your Hand**: Similarly, you know one card is yellow (position 1), but the yellow stack is at Y0, meaning ideally a Y1 is needed. This card's exact number is unknown—playing it now is too risky.\n- **Unknown Card (Position 4)**: With no hints about this card, it's unclear and risky to play or discard if it could potentially be useful.\n\n### Consider Teammates' Hands\n- **Player +1**: Has cards 'G3', 'B2', 'G4', 'G3', 'B1'. You can see two 'G3' cards, and the green stack is at G1. However, the next required green is G2, not G3. 'B2' is safely playable since the blue stack is at B0.\n- **Player +2**: Has a 'Y4' (they know it’s yellow), 'B2', 'B4', 'Y5', 'B3'. The only directly playable card here is 'B2' since it matches the next sequence in the blue stack.\n\n### Evaluate Legal Actions\n- Given the limited info tokens, giving a hint could be valuable but may not enable immediate beneficial plays because neither player seems ready to play a card they don't know about without further clarity.\n- Discarding one of your cards could be wise to regain an info token, especially considering your lack of total knowledge about your cards, making them risky to play directly.\n\n### Action Consideration\n- **Best Discard**: Discarding the unknown card ('Card 4') might be a strategic choice. Given its absolute uncertainty and the potential of holding a duplicate or non-immediate necessary rank, it’s the safest to discard among unknowns. This gains an info token without risking a needed but unknown play.\n- **Playing a Card**: Risky without more info, especially with only 1 life token remaining.\n- **Giving a Hint**: With only 1 info token, not advisable unless it guaranteed a correct play or blocked a poor discard.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the situation:\n- **Action**: Discard the completely unknown card (position 4) to gain an info token.\n- **Reason**: It increases resources (info tokens) while minimizing risks of losing a life token due to incorrect play.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Discarding the unknown card to safely gain an information token, minimizing risk and potentially enabling more strategic plays or hints in future turns.\", \"action\": 4}\n```"

However, since G1 is on the table, and considering the possible identities (G12345), G2 is a logical next play if available.\n\n### Assessing Teammates' Hands\n- **Player +1's Hand**: \n    - G3 (Cannot be played as G2 is not down yet).\n    - B2 cannot be played immediately (B1 must be played first).\n- **Player +2's Hand**: \n    - Y4 cannot be played (Y1, Y2, and Y3 need to be played first).\n    - B2 and B4, as with Player +1, aren't immediately playable.\n\n### Discarding vs. Playing\n- Given that the discard option results in gaining an Info Token (which can't be done due to 0 info tokens and the necessity of preserving the single life token), and the positive identification of a necessary card in your hand (a likely G2), **playing a card** is the recommended action over discarding.\n\n### Recommended Action\n- Based on the known info in your hand ('GX' for multiple cards) and deducing from the fireworks (G1 on the table, needing G2):\n    - Card position 0 (listed as 'GX', possible identities 'G12345') is chosen for an attempt to play what is logically and possibly the G2.\n\nThe play is a calculated risk, informed by the current state of the fireworks and the information received from hints.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Playing G2 is a critical move to advance the green fireworks which already has G1 played. Green cards are identified in my hand, making G2 a logical next card to attempt playing.\", \"action\": 5}\n``` \n\nThis action aims to logically extend the Green fireworks sequence and is based on hint-received and current firework status.

        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

Since I'm participating as a player, I can't see my own cards but can see the hands of my teammates. Here’s a strategic approach we can consider to maximize our score.\n\n### 1. Use Hints Effectively\n- **Prioritize hints** for cards that are immediately playable or will be soon. For example, if we’re currently at R1 in the fireworks and someone holds an R2, that’s a prime candidate for a hint.\n- **Balance color and number hints** depending on which offers the most clear direction. If a player has multiple 2s but only one is currently playable, consider if a color hint might more specifically guide the play.\n\n### 2. Playing Cards\n- **Follow the hints**, and play the card if you were recently given a targeted hint likely indicating its playability.\n- **If unsure**, consider holding off on playing to avoid losing a life token. The risk of a wrong play is higher without a recent hint specifically about a card’s playability.\n\n### 3. Discarding Cards\n- **Discard wisely** when out of information tokens. It's generally safer to discard older cards that haven’t been hinted about, as they are less likely to be immediately needed.\n- **Avoid discarding potential key cards**. For instance, since there are fewer 5s and fewer high number cards, discarding these can be risky unless you’re confident they are duplicates or currently unusable.\n\n### 4. Managing Tokens\n- **Conserve info tokens** for critical hints. We should avoid giving hints that are too marginal in benefit.\n- **Recover tokens** judiciously by discarding when we have a good understanding of the non-critical nature of a card in hand.\n\n### 5. Strategic Considerations\n- **Endgame foresight**: As the game nears its end and the deck depletes, shift focus to playing and hinting about cards that can definitely be played to ensure a higher score.\n- **Track discarded cards**: This will help in understanding what remains in the deck and what cards we definitely need to avoid discarding.\n\n### Communication and Cooperation\n- Although direct communication about hand contents is prohibited, using the provided hints maximally and observing the plays and hints given by teammates are crucial.\n- Reacting contextually to the hints (like if given a hint about a color when no number is playable, assuming a future utility of the hinted card) helps in strategizing further moves.\n\nWith this strategic outline, we aim to collaborate effectively, maintain a good flow of hints, make intelligent plays and discards, and manage our tokens wisely to achieve the highest score possible in our game of Hanabi. Let's work together and aim for that perfect score of 25!"

Given the current game state, 'Y2' is immediately playable.\n- **Player +2’s Hand:** Contains 'Y2', 'W3', 'R4', 'G2', 'G5'. Here, also 'Y2' is immediately playable.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nThe best action currently is to maximize the use of an info token to enable a direct play that safely increments our score. Both Player +1 and Player +2 hold a 'Y2' which is immediately playable. Giving a hint to either player about this can guarantee a safe play without risking a wrong play or loss of a life token.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Action:** Give a hint about the 'Y2' to Player +1.\n- **Reasoning:** It is beneficial because it:\n  1. Ensures a correct play, adding to the firework stack.\n  2. Uses an info token when we have ample, helping progress the game.\n  3. Avoids risking an incorrect play from my uncertain cards.\n\n### JSON Output:\nThe legal action to reveal color 'Y' to Player +1 fits our strategy as it targets the 'Y2' specifically. Here's the chosen action in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Enabling Player +1 to play 'Y2' directly, which is immediately playable and will correctly progress the yellow firework stack.\", \"action\": 11}\n```"

Analyzing my hand and the known hints about each card:\n\n1. Card 1 has no hints and represents a broad possibility of colors and numbers.\n2. Card 2 is known to be red but lacks a specific number; however, since no red cards have been played, any R1 would be ideal to begin the red stack.\n3. Card 3 also lacks specific hints, much like Card 1.\n4. Card 4 similarly has no detailed hint which makes it risky to consider for immediate play without further information.\n5. Card 5 has been specifically identified as Red 1 (R1). This is a perfect candidate because it precisely fits the current requirement to begin the red fireworks stack (R stack is at 0).\n\nAs the Red 1 card can be definitely played to initiate the red fireworks and no other card in my hand offers such direct and safe value at the moment, the best legal action is to play this card.\n\nHere is my decision in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Card 5 is identified as R1, which is needed to start the red fireworks.

Since only R2 and G2 can be played next (R stack is at 1 and G stack is at 0), and we know R2 is another card (Card 2), it might be G2. However, this card includes a risk as it could also be Y2 or B2.\n- **Card 5**: Completely unknown and wide range of possibilities.\n\n### Consider Teammates' Hands and Playable Cards\n- **Player +1’s Hand**: \n  - 'Y2' is known and playable because Y stack is at 0 and could be the starting card.\n- **Player +2's Hand**: \n  - 'G2' looks tempting to hint or play if info tokens were available.\n  - 'W3' should not be played yet as the White firework stack is at W1, needing W2 first.\n\n### Tokens and Immediate Actions\n- **Info tokens are at 0**, limiting our ability to hint. Hence no hints can be provided this turn.\n- The best immediate scoring opportunity is to **play a known playable card**.\n\n### Best Move Determination\nConsidering no hints can be given and the urgent need to open up opportunities for future plays by freeing up info tokens through safe discards later, the clearest action is playing the card which is absolutely certain:\n\n- **Card 2 (R2)** is directly playable with no ambiguity, as it matches the next required card for the Red firework.\n\nGiven these considerations and the mechanics of the game, the suggested play would be:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Card 2 is known to be R2, perfectly matching the next required card for Red firework which is currently at R1.

These are potential candidates for playing since:\n     - Y stack is at 0 (meaning a Y1 is needed before Y2),\n     - G stack is at 0 (meaning a G1 is needed before G2),\n     - B stack is at 0 (meaning a B1 is needed before B2),\n   - So, **Card 3 is not currently playable** without risk.\n\n2. **Player +1's Hand**:\n   - **W4** is not playable as the W stack is at 1 (W2 is needed next).\n   - **R3** is playable because the R stack is currently at 2.\n\n3. **Player +2's Hand**:\n   - **G2** is noticeable, but as mentioned, a G1 needs to be played first.\n   - **Y1** is definitely playable since the Y stack is at 0.\n\n### Decision Making\n- **Hints**: You have only **1 info token**, which means giving a hint should provide strong potential for a successful play to avoid wasting this precious resource.\n- **Playing Cards**: It seems not sensible to play any card from your hand due to uncertainties and high risk.\n- **Discards**: Given the risk in your current knowledge, discarding could be considered to regain an info token, but since all your cards might be necessary, this is risky unless you are very sure of what you discard.\n\nGiven the visible cards in Player +2's hand (where a Y1 is definitely playable), the ideal action would be to allow them to play Y1. Since they currently don't know that they are holding a Y1, giving them this information would lead directly to a successful play and is the best use of the limited info token.\n\n### Recommended Action\nInform Player +2 about the color of the card (Y1), which they can play immediately.

        "content": "In this scenario, we need to carefully consider our options, given that there are 0 info tokens left. Since no hints can be given, the focus should be on playing or discarding cards. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the best move.\n\n## Current Fireworks State:\n- **Red**: 2\n- **Yellow**: 0\n- **Green**: 0\n- **White**: 1\n- **Blue**: 0\n\n## Cards Visibility and Play Options:\n- **Your Hand**: No informative hints except for Card 3 being possibly a '2' of either yellow, green, or blue.\n- **Player +1's Hand**: Contains a 'G1', which is immediately playable.\n- **Player +2's Hand**: Contains a 'Y1' which is playable.\n\n## Decision Making:\n- **Play Options**: You need to evaluate the potential risk of playing a card. Since you have a hint only on Card 3 indicating it's a 2 and considering the board (none of the colors that can be a 2 is ready for it), playing Card 3 could be risky.\n- **Discard Options**: Since no hints can be given (due to 0 info tokens), discarding a card to gain an info token is crucial. Choosing a card with the least impact if lost is key. Given that your hand contains multiple cards identified only as potential multi-value, and multi-color (like Card 0, 1, or 4), any of these could be a safe discard, ideally one with the broadest possible identities which might indicate it's less likely to be immediately useful.\n\nGiven the above considerations and the game state where gaining an info token is urgently needed:\n- You should opt to discard a card from your hand that has the least detrimental impact on game progression and which might not be immediately needed.\n\n## Suggested Action:\nDiscard Card 1. It has a wide range of possible identities ('YGB345'), and without more specific information, it's hard to ascertain its immediate utility. Discarding it will recover an info token, which can be used in subsequent turns to give useful hints, especially considering the crucial plays that can be made soon by your teammates.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Discarding to gain an info token for future rounds as no info tokens are available and no clear play can be made without risk.\",\n  \"action\": 1\n}\n```"

Since the Y stack and B stack are at 0, and the G stack is also at 0, playing this card would risk a life token as its exact identity isn't certain. Despite the number match (2), color is not confirmed.\n- **Player +1's Hand**:\n  - **Card: 'G1'** is a visible green 1, which is immediately playable since the green stack is at 0.\n  - Other cards in this player's hand either do not match current needs or lack sufficient identity clarity for play.\n- **Player +2's Hand**:\n  - **Card: 'Y1'** is a visible yellow 1, necessary since the yellow stack is at 0. This card is playable right now.\n  - **Card: 'G2'** should be considered for future play once G1 from Player +1 is played.\n\n## Optimal Play\n- **Immediate Playable Cards**: From Player +2's hand 'Y1' can immediately be played. This action does not require any information token as the card is already identified by color.\n- **Information Token Strategy**: With only 1 info token left and critical plays visible, it's risky to spend it unless it ensures further plays or prevents incorrect plays.\n\n## Decision\nTo advance the game state effectively without risking a life token and leveraging visible opportunities in other players' hands, the most strategic action is to instruct Player +2 to play the 'Y1'.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Player +2 has a clearly identified 'Y1' which is the next required card for the yellow stack and can be played with certainty to advance the game.\", \"action\": 24}\n```\n\nThis action uses the game's current layout effectively by advancing a firework stack without risking incorrect plays or wasting limited information tokens. Moreover, it sets up potential further plays like playing G1 by Player +1 in a later turn, which sequentially could allow playing G2 visible in Player +2's hand. This strategy maximizes the effective use of known information and available actions."

Since the green stack is at 0, playing 'G1' will initiate the green firework sequence.\n\n## Updated Decision\nGiven the objective to promote game progression using the clear opportunities in other players' hands:\n- To facilitate an immediate play, **Player +1 should play 'G1'**. This action requires no hint and advances the game.

Instead, it is better to utilize my turn to potentially set up future plays or make sure that the plays occur correctly through hints.\n\nWith 1 info token, a valuable move could be hinting to Player +1 to confirm the playability of a specific card rank (since their 'G1' is critically needed now and playing it can lead to a chain of further plays like 'G2' from Player +2):\n\nAvailable actions related to hinting:\n- **(Reveal player +1 rank 1)**: This will specifically confirm that 'G1' is a rank 1 and should be played next, aligning with the necessary progression of fireworks.\n\nSince ensuring a correct play by Player +1 is crucial right now to keep the game advancing smoothly and to potentially allow for future plays (such as 'G2'), I will choose to give a hint regarding the rank to Player +1.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Giving a rank 1 hint to Player +1 ensures the correct identification and prioritized play of 'G1', crucial for advancing the green stack seamlessly.\", \"action\": 20}\n```\n\nThis action uses the available info token strategically by ensuring that the right card gets played, facilitating the efficient progression of the fireworks, and setting the stage for subsequent necessary plays."

It is important to choose a card whose loss would have minimal impact on the progress of completing the fireworks.\n\n### Analyzing Your Hand for Discard:\n- **Card 1** (\"Possible identities: 'YGB345'\"): This card could potentially be a Yellow, Green, or Blue with higher numbers. Since G2 has not been played yet and B1 is not completed, discarding a potential G3, G4, G5, or B3, B4, B5 carries risks.\n- **Card 2** (\"Known info: 'X2', Possible identities: 'YGB2'\"): This card is known to be a '2' and is either Yellow, Green, or Blue. With current available stacks (Y0, G1, B0), this card has a potential to be B2, which is playable.\n- **Card 3** (\"Known info: 'RX', Possible identities: 'R1345'\"): It might be a Red card of rank 1, 3, 4, or 5. With R2 already played, only R3 is needed next.\n- **Card 4** (\"Known info: 'RX', Possible identities: 'R12345'\"): Similar to Card 3, but could also be R1 which is not needed anymore.\n- **Card 5** (\"Possible identities: 'YGWB12345'\"): This card is the most ambiguous, covering almost all ranks and colors except Green.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Card 4** can be discarded due to a higher risk associated with keeping two unknown red cards when the next required red card is R3, and since R1 and R2 are already played, it might contain R1 which is not needed anymore. \n\nChoosing to discard Card 4 enables us to regain an info token, necessary for future hints, while minimizing the risk of discarding a crucial card given that we are sure R1 is not required and there's a duplicate for red cards in hand.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Discarding card 4 to regain an info token, as it is least likely to contain a critical card immediately needed for progression (R1 already played, and there's a duplicate for red cards).\", \"action\": 3}\n```"

No immediately useful card (i.e., Y1, G2, or B1) is present.\n- **Card 2**: Known as a '2' and can be Y2, G2, or B2. Y2 cards are already discarded twice, so it cannot be Y2. G2 is also discarded, leaving B2 which is indeed playable as there is no B in the fireworks yet.\n- **Card 3**: Known to be red but can be R1, R3, R4, or R5. R3 and R2 are discarded, making R3 not possible; R5 is also discarded. It’s potentially dangerous to play this without knowing the exact number.\n- **Card 4 and Card 5**: No useful information.\n\n### Analysis of Teammates' Cards:\n- **Player +1** has visible cards like Y4, and W4, which are not immediately playable.\n- **Player +2** holds Y1, which is definitely playable as Y stack is at 0.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nGiven the visibility of Y1 in Player +2's hand which is guaranteed to be playable (Y stack at 0), the best move would be to ensure Player +2 knows that their Y1 can be played. We have one info token, and a direct hint can facilitate an immediate and correct play, increasing our fireworks' score without risk.\n\n### Action Selection:\nTo communicate effectively that the yellow card is playable, we can use the hint on color to Player +2 indicating yellow. This will make Player +2 aware that they hold a playable yellow card. This move is efficient, makes use of the available info token, and directly contributes to our score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Directing Player +2 to play Y1, which is immediately playable and increases our score safely.\",\n  \"action\": 16\n}\n```"

It's not safe to play without more specific hints.\n- **Card 2 (X2 - YGB2)**: This card is a rank 2 but without knowing its color, playing it is risky. The colors it could be are already advanced past 1 (R2, G1), so it might be playable if it's Yellow or Blue.\n- **Card 3 (RX - R1345)**: The R3 might be safe to play as the Red stack is currently at R2. Other Red cards are risky as the sequences for 1, 4, and 5 are not ready yet.\n- **Card 4 and Card 5 (XX - YGWB12345)**: Both these cards have no hints and cover a wide range of possibilities. They are unsafe to play currently.\n\n### Analyzing Teammates' Hands:\n- **Player +1**: They have a 'Y4' which is not yet ready to play (Yellow stack is at Y0); however, 'Y1' could be immediately played.\n- **Player +2**: Holds a 'Y1', which is currently playable since the Yellow stack is at Y0. They also have a 'G2' which is immediately playable since the Green stack is at G1.\n\n### Best Action:\nSince you have 0 info tokens and cannot give a hint, the best course of action involves playing or discarding. Discarding might be necessary to regain info tokens for future rounds, but a safe play based on available information is more immediate beneficial.\n\n- **Playing 'R3' from your hand (RX - R1345)**: Since the Red stack is at R2, playing the R3 is a safe move and advances the game score with little risk.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe proposed action is to play the 'R3' from your hand, which is your Card 3.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"The Red stack is at R2, and I have a 'R3' as indicated by the hint.

This card cannot immediately be played safely.\n- **Card 2**: Known as '2', identities: YGB2. This could be playable if it's Blue or Yellow.\n- **Card 3**: Too many possibilities, no play yet.\n- **Card 4 and 5**: Also uncertain, no play.\n\n### Teammates' Playable Cards:\n- **Player +1**: Has a 'Y4' and 'B2'. Neither can be immediately played.\n- **Player +2**: Has 'Y1', which is immediately playable and opens up the Yellow stack.\n\n### Immediate Playable Options:\n- **Player +2's 'Y1'** needs to be played to start the Yellow stack.\n\n### Hints Needed:\n- Ensuring that Player +2 plays 'Y1' is critical. Although 'Y1' is identified as a Yellow card, confirming its playability can encourage the player to play it.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nGiven the hints already provided and considering there are 2 info tokens, it is beneficial to either play a card that is known to be correct (which at the moment none in your hand can be guaranteed without further information) or use hints to guide team actions effectively.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the most impactful action is to further ensure that Player +2 recognizes the playability of 'Y1'. Thus, using a hint to emphasize the color or rank can be helpful despite it being known. However, since the life tokens are critically low, and direct plays are dangerous without full information, reinforcing the hint on 'Y1' seems redundant.\n\nAlternatively, supporting Player +2's hand with more color information could help in planning future plays:\n\n**Chosen Action Description:**\n- Give a hint about the color Green to Player +2. This consolidates knowledge about three cards ('G5', 'G4', 'G1'), making future plays safer and potentially clarifying discard options.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"By hinting Green to Player +2, we help solidify the plans for future plays with multiple Green cards, aiding in strategic sequencing of the Green stack which can continue from G1 to G4 and finally G5.\", \"action\": 17}\n```"

        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

Even though the card is marked with its color, without knowing its rank, Player +2 might hesitate to play it.\n\n3. **Use of Info Tokens**: \n   - Given that there are only 2 info tokens left, using one for a rank hint is crucial. Specifically, revealing the rank of 'R2' to Player +2 allows them to confidently play this card and advance the Red firework stack.\n\n4. **Action Decision**: \n   - The action to take is giving a rank hint to Player +2. The rank hint should be '2', which will confirm to Player +2 that their 'R2' card is playable. This hint not only enables a direct play but also conserves the remaining hints for future critical plays as the game progresses.\n\n5. **Long-Term Considerations**: \n   - After playing 'R2', we expect future possibilities where other ranks and colors will need to be disclosed, especially focusing on completing the Yellow and Green stacks from zero. It will be important to regain info tokens through strategic discards soon.\n\nHere's the formulated action as a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Reveal the rank '2' to Player +2 to enable them to play their R2 card, progressing the Red firework and optimizing the use of a limited info token.\", \"action\": 26}\n```\n\nThis action should help progress the game efficiently by enabling a guaranteed correct play, maintaining life tokens, and strategically using the available info tokens."

Y1 is immediately playable.\n   - Player +2 has a green 3, yellow 3, blue 2, and an R1. B2 (Blue 2) is immediately playable as no blue cards are on the stack yet.\n\n### Optimal Move Consideration:\n- Since there are no info tokens available to give hints, and hints are crucial for coordinating plays in Hanabi, gaining an info token becomes a priority. You also want to avoid discarding potentially useful cards prematurely.\n  \n- Examining Player +1 and Player +2's cards:\n  - Player +1's Y1 should be played by them on their turn to start the yellow stack.\n  - Player +2's B2 should be played by them to start the blue stack.\n\n### Decision:\n- To regain an info token and avoid losing more life tokens by an incorrect play (due to incomplete information on your own cards), your best move is to discard a card which is least likely to harm the progress.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n- **Discarding Card 0** seems safe because you don't have specific clues about it, and it's unclear which among the multiple possible identities (RGWB1345) it has, making it a riskier play. Discarding this card gains you an info token without severely impacting game progress, assuming key cards (like yellow 1 or blue 2 etc.) are not in your hand, which you can't confirm.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Discarding card 0 to gain an info token due to lack of clues and high risk of playing an incorrect card. This action avoids risking a life token and prepares us for better informed future turns.\", \"action\": 0}\n```\n\nThis move retains the approach of playing safe while aiming to build our capability to coordinate through hints in the subsequent rounds."

        "content": "Based on the current game state and the detailed analysis of visible cards and possible actions, here is the thought process for choosing the best move:\n\n1. **Evaluate Playable Cards in Your Hand:** \n   - Since no specific hints have been given about your own cards, and only possible identities have been deduced, it's risky to play any of them without more information.\n\n2. **Teammates' Cards Analysis:**\n   - Player +1's hand has a 'Y1' which is not yet played and the Y stack is at 0. This is an immediately playable card.\n   - Player +2 has a visible 'R1', and the R stack is at 0, making it another immediately playable card.\n\n3. **Hint Opportunities:**\n   - You have only 1 info token left. Therefore, a hint should be highly impactful.\n   - By hinting at Player +2’s color 'R', you enable them to know their 'R1' is playable. This is crucial because starting a new color stack (like Red here) opens up more opportunities for further plays.\n\n4. **Assess Discard Options:**\n   - Discarding might be necessary soon to regain info tokens for more hints, but with a possible play identified, it's better to facilitate it.\n\nGiven that you can't play a card reliably from your hand due to insufficient information and considering the importance of starting the Red firework series, the optimal choice here is to reveal the red cards to Player +2. This allows for an immediate safe play of the 'R1' card by Player +2 on their turn. Thus, the action chosen is to reveal the color Red to Player +2.\n\nHere is the decision in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Enables Player +2 to play 'R1', starting the Red firework, maximizing safe and immediate scoring opportunities.\", \"action\": 15}\n```"

No hints about other cards.\n- **Player +1's Hand:** They have a Green 5, which is currently not playable as the Green sequence is only at 1. They also have a Yellow 1, which is immediately playable.\n- **Player +2's Hand:** They have a Blue 2, which isn't playable yet, and some Green cards where sequence is only at 1.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nWith the situation where you're low on both life tokens and info tokens, the safest and most beneficial move currently is to allow Player +1 to play the Yellow 1 since it's playable and will open up space for potentially getting more info tokens soon.\n\nAs you cannot directly play or hint (due to no info tokens), and there is a direct playable card in Player +1’s hand, the best course of action is to discard a card from your hand that is least likely to be needed soon. Considering that:\n- You suspect one of your cards is Yellow 3, 4, or 5, where the Yellow sequence is not even started,\n- It's risky to play without full knowledge due to only 1 life token,\n\nYou should opt to discard a card to recover an info token which might become critical for future plays.\n\n**Action Selection:**\nChoose to discard Card 4:\n- It has unknown details (XX),\n- It's among the larger set of possible identities (covering all colors and numbers),\n- It minimizes the risk of discarding a card that can immediately progress a firework.\n\nHere is the output as per request format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Recovering an info token for future hints while minimizing risk since Card 4 has the least known information and covers a broad possibility of identities, making it less likely immediately essential.\",\n  \"action\": 3\n}\n```"

        "content": "Given the current state of the game, with only 1 life token and 1 info token remaining, and several cards on the verge of being playable, a strategic decision is necessary. Here's a detailed thought process:\n\n1. **Current Fireworks Progress**: \n   - Red: 2\n   - Yellow: 0\n   - Green: 1\n   - White: 1\n   - Blue: 0\n\n2. **Your Hand Analysis**:\n   - **Card 1**: Known as Yellow (Y345). Since the yellow stack is at 0, you only play Y1 safely.\n   - **Card 2, 3, 4, 5**: There’s no specific hint that allows for safe play of these cards.\n\n3. **Teammate Hands**:\n   - **Player +1**: \n     - They have a Yellow 1 (Y1) which can be played, but might not be aware since no direct hint was given specifically regarding its rank.\n   - **Player +2**:\n     - Has a Blue 1 (B1) which is also playable as the blue stack is at 0.\n\n4. **Hint Options**:\n   - Hints that enable immediate safe plays are highly valuable, especially when low on life tokens.\n\n**Optimal Decision**:\n- **Hint \"Yellow\" to Player +1**: This will make them aware that the Yellow 1 is playable, ensuring a safe play to enhance the score and avoiding the risk of losing the game by playing a wrong card. Since you only have one info token, and there’s a potential loss if a mistake is made, using the hint to guarantee a correct play is most crucial.\n\nChoosing this action not only helps to proceed cautiously (given the limited life tokens) but also strategically builds the score by maximizing the chances of correct plays. Hence, the chosen action is:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Hinting 'Yellow' to Player +1 to ensure they recognize Y1 as playable, thereby advancing the Yellow firework stack safely and preserving our remaining life token.\", \"action\": 11}\n```"
