        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Great! I'm ready to step into the role of a master Hanabi player. To summarize our understanding and approach:\n\n1. The Objective and Core Mechanics\n • We cooperate to build up five “fireworks” (one per color) in numerical order (from 1 to 5).\n • On each turn, we can provide a hint to a teammate, discard one of our own cards (which gives back an Info token), or play one of our cards.\n • Each hint must be completely accurate—the hint only signals positions in another player’s hand that match the mentioned color or number.\n • Playing a card out of sequence costs a life token. If we run out of life tokens, the game ends in failure.\n • The game concludes if we complete all fireworks (a perfect score of 25), deplete the deck triggering the final rounds, or lose by exhausting life tokens.\n\n2. Tokens and Their Importance\n • Life Tokens: We want to avoid any mistakes, as each misplayed card reduces our life tokens.\n • Info Tokens: These are required to give hints. Although the exact maximum isn’t provided here, managing them wisely is critical—sometimes we even discard purposely to recover an info token if it’s safe to do so.\n\n3. Strategic Considerations and Play\n • Hinting: Look for opportunities to hint on cards that are either immediately playable (for example, if a teammate holds a card that can continue a firework stack) or cards that are in danger of being discarded unnecessarily. For instance, if you see that a teammate’s card of a critical color (like Red if they have a 1, which is essential for that stack) hasn’t been hinted at, a clue might be timely.\n • Playing: When enough hints or context tells you that a card is safe—meaning all other possibilities have been eliminated or teammate hints clearly indicate it’s needed—go ahead and play it.\n • Discarding: Only discard if you have enough information that the card won’t be useful later (or if it’s a duplicate that would hinder your final score). Discarding can also be a mechanism to gain an info token if you’re running low.\n • Communication and Observation: Always pay attention to any hints other players give about your cards and use that information to deduce which cards are safe to play or discard. Given that while you see everyone else’s cards, others can’t see yours, our hints must be both precise and minimal.\n\n4. Managing the Game State\n • Maintain a mental (or agreed upon) record of the current progress on each firework, the token counts, and the discard pile. For example, if the progress is R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0, you know exactly which cards are needed next (Red needs a 2, Green needs a 2, etc.).\n • Use the discard pile to determine if a necessary card is ever at risk of being lost (for instance, if too many copies of a specific number/color move to discard, planning is required).\n\n5. Our Next Steps\nSince the game state may evolve round by round, let’s consider the following approach when it's our turn:\n • Evaluate visible cards in teammates’ hands and determine if any possess an immediately playable card.\n • If a teammate’s card is clearly in danger (e.g., a 1 that hasn’t been hinted and is needed to start a stack), consider giving a hint.\n • If you have enough evidence about one of your own cards being discardable (and you need an info token), then a discard might be the best move.\n • Otherwise, if you’re confident (based on previous hints and information) that one of your cards is the next in sequence for one of the fireworks, play that card.\n\nWith these principles in mind, I’m prepared to help guide our moves or simulate a round of play. Let me know the current game state or a particular scenario you’d like to work through, and we can discuss and determine the best action together!"

Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters.

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1.

The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters.

        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "Great! I'm ready to dive in as your Hanabi expert. We’ll work together using the following strategy pillars:\n\n1. Planning and Prioritization:\n • Always work to complete the 1s first. Without them, no other card can be played.\n • Plan hints in a way that helps teammates deduce which cards are playable next.\n • Keep track of the current state of all fireworks (which card is next for each color).\n\n2. Effective Use of Information Tokens:\n • Use a hint to provide the most valuable information—either about a safe card that can be played immediately or about a key card needed to build a firework.\n • Don’t be afraid to give hints even if the token count isn’t high, but always try to recover tokens by discarding non-critical cards whenever possible.\n\n3. Playing and Discarding:\n • Only play a card when you feel it is absolutely safe. A hint from a teammate indicating that a card in your hand is the next needed card in a firework is a good cue to play it.\n • If a card is clearly worthless (e.g., if it’s already been played, or discarding it won’t jeopardize a potential run), consider discarding it to regain an Info token.\n • When discarding, be cautious not to discard too early; sometimes what seems like an expendable card might be key later in the game.\n\n4. Communication Through Hints:\n • Hints can only mention a color or a number, so craft them in such a way that teammates can deduce both if possible.\n • For example, hinting “red” when you have a red card that is safe to play might imply it’s the next red card in sequence.\n • If a teammate sees a hint that signals safety or urgency, it’s a cue for them to either play or discard as needed.\n\n5. Game State Awareness:\n • Always keep a mental note of the current status of the fireworks (like R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0), and prioritize plays that extend these runs.\n • Make sure that hints are timely—if a card is close to being lost (e.g., if you’re nearing the deck’s end or you have few life tokens remaining), focus on moves that safely advance the game.\n\nNow, please share the current game state—for example, the details of the Life tokens, Info tokens, the progress on each firework, and the cards visible in your teammates’ hands. With that information, I can help determine the best move: whether to hint, discard, or play. Let me know the details, and we’ll plan our strategy accordingly!"

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.
