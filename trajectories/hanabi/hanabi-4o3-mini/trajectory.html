<h3>Player Response:</h3>
<p>{'reason': 'Card 3 has been hinted as rank 1, and for any non-yellow color it is immediately playable since the R, G, W, and B stacks all need a 1. Although there is a 20% chance it might be yellow (and thus unplayable because the yellow stack is already at 1), the odds are strongly in our favor at 80% for a safe play. The other cards in my hand lack direct information and are riskier. With only one info token available (which is valuable for giving hints later), the best move is to play the card that has a high probability of working. Therefore, I will play Card 3.', 'action': 7}</p>

Meanwhile, our teammates show several immediately playable cards (like Y2 with Player +1 and R2 with Player +3) that we could hint about if we had an info token. Discarding one of my unknown cards will restore an info token so that I can safely guide a teammate to play a correct card. Thus, discarding card 0 is the safest and most strategic move.', 'action': 0}</p>

In contrast, our card at position 3 might be useful if it turns out to be a white1 or blue1. Since several teammates already hold cards that are (or could be) immediately playable if they get a hint, our best move is to discard a card that is least likely to be crucial. Discarding card 0 will generate an info token and preserve our higher-potential cards. Therefore, I choose to discard card 0.', 'action': 0}</p>

<h3>Player Response:</h3>
<p>{'reason': 'We have 0 info tokens and don’t want to risk playing one of our own cards that we have no information on—each card is only about 20% likely to be playable given the current needs (R2, Y2, G2, W1, or B1). Meanwhile, our teammates hold several cards that are immediately playable if they receive guidance (for example, Player +1 holds Y2, B1, W1, and G2; Player +2 holds Y2; Player +3 holds R2). To quickly regain an info token so that we can provide a hint to help a teammate play a card safely, it’s best to discard one of our own cards. Since none of our cards have any hints yet and are all equally unknown, discarding the first card (position 0) is a safe option.', 'action': 0}</p>

<h3>Player Response:</h3>
<p>{'reason': "We have 0 info tokens and none of our cards is clearly safe to play. Examining our hand, cards 1 and 2 are each hinted as a '2' with possibilities Y2 or G2 – if they are G2 they’re immediately playable (since green is at 1), but a Y2 would cause an illegal play because yellow needs a 4 next. That puts them at roughly a 50% chance of being playable. Card 3 is hinted as a '4' with possibilities from Y, G, W, B. Only if it is Y4 (a 1 in 4 probability) would it be immediately playable (yellow stacking requires a 4), while its other possibilities aren’t playable right now. Cards 4 and 5 are completely unspecific and carry too wide a range of possibilities. In this situation, the least risky card to sacrifice is Card 3 (position 2) because it has only about a 25% chance to be the immediately needed Y4. Discarding it will grant an info token, which we will need to guide our teammates on their safe plays. Therefore, the best move is to discard Card 3 (position 2).", 'action': 2}</p>

<p>{'reason': 'We have 0 info tokens and cannot give a hint, so we must either play a card (which carries a significant risk of a misplay and losing a life) or discard to recover an info token. In my hand, Card 3 has already been partially hinted as a rank 3, and if it happens to be white 3 it’s immediately playable (since the white firework is at 2). The other cards (Cards 0, 1, 2, and 4) are completely unhinted and each has an equal roughly 20% chance of being one of the scarce needed cards (R4, Y4, G2, or B2). Preserving the card with a hint is preferable, so I choose to sacrifice one of the fully unknown cards.

<p>{'reason': 'We have 0 info tokens, so we cannot give a hint even though some teammates have immediately playable cards. With life tokens still available, a misplay would cost a life, so the safest option is to try to gain an info token by discarding. In our hand, all cards are totally unhinted, but card 5 has the widest candidate list including numbers (1 and 2) that are now unplayable in the current firework sequences—the playable cards in each color have become very specific (red and yellow need a 4, green and white need a 3, and blue needs a 2). Card 5’s candidate list (RYGWB12345) gives it only a roughly 20% chance of actually matching the needed number (it must be the exact number for its color), making it comparatively the least promising candidate to play. Discarding it is the optimal choice to retrieve an info token so that we can later cue our teammates on their immediately playable cards (such as the obvious W3 in player +1’s hand).', 'action': 4}</p>

Among my cards, the ones with a known rank of 4 (cards 3 and 5, i.e. hand positions 2 and 4) are almost certainly not helpful since only a yellow 4 (1 out of 4 possibilities) would be playable and red 4 is already unavailable. In contrast, the unknown cards (cards 1 and 4) and the green card (card 2) may later prove useful if they match needed plays. Therefore, discarding one of the rank 4 cards to gain an info token is the best option, so that on a subsequent turn I can give a hint—most importantly, about blue—to help Player +1 play their blue 2.

<p>{'reason': 'We have 0 info tokens and no clues on our own cards, meaning any play would be quite risky (only about a 15%-16% chance of being immediately playable). Gaining an info token is crucial so that we can later give hints to teammates about their safe plays. In particular, Card 2 (position 1) has a slightly lower chance (~15%) of being the needed card (i.e. R4, G3, or W3) compared to some other cards. By discarding it, we minimize the potential cost while generating an info token for the team.', 'action': 1}</p>
