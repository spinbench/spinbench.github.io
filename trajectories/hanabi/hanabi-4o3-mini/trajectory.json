That puts them at roughly a 50% chance of being playable. Card 3 is hinted as a '4' with possibilities from Y, G, W, B. Only if it is Y4 (a 1 in 4 probability) would it be immediately playable (yellow stacking requires a 4), while its other possibilities aren\u2019t playable right now. Cards 4 and 5 are completely unspecific and carry too wide a range of possibilities. In this situation, the least risky card to sacrifice is Card 3 (position 2) because it has only about a 25% chance to be the immediately needed Y4. Discarding it will grant an info token, which we will need to guide our teammates on their safe plays. Therefore, the best move is to discard Card 3 (position 2).",
