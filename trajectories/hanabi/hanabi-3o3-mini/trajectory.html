<h3>Player Response:</h3>
<p>{'reason': "None of my cards are immediately safe to play. Although card 4 could be red1 (needed to start the red firework), its chances are uncertain and playing it risks losing a life if it turns out to be red2-5. Meanwhile, the three unknown cards (positions 0, 1, and 2) cannot ever be 1 (they're only Y, G, W, or B with ranks 2-5) and so are not immediately playable. In addition, none of our teammates holds a card that's immediately playable given the current fireworks (yellow is already at 1, and none has a 1 for red, green, white, or blue). It is thus wiser to safely discard one of my non-playable unknown cards (card 0) to gain an info token and refresh my hand in hopes of drawing a critical 1 (like red1).", 'action': 0}</p>

With 4 in 5 possibilities being playable, card 5 presents an 80% chance to extend a firework, while none of the other cards are immediately playable.

<h3>Player Response:</h3>
<p>{'reason': 'None of the visible cards from any player are immediately playable given the current stacks. Our own hand is completely unknown, so taking a risky play is not advisable. We currently have full information tokens, so it is a good opportunity to help a teammate with useful information. Player +1 holds two cards that are both rank 4 (G4 and R4). Since the red stack needs a 2 (and green needs a 1), these rank 4 cards cannot be played right now. Revealing that they are rank 4 will allow player +1 to recognize that these cards are not immediately useful and can be safely discarded later to regain tokens if needed. This hint sets up a safer discard strategy without risking a life, so I will choose to reveal rank 4 to player +1.', 'action': 23}</p>

Meanwhile, cards 2 and 3 might be R3 (playable for Red since Red is at 2), so they deserve to be kept. Card 4 and 5 are fully ambiguous and could be valuable later. By discarding card 1, I regain an info token that I can use to hint to player +1 about their G1 (which is critical since Green is at 0 and a 1 is needed to start that stack).

In contrast, card 5 is marked as green, and since the green firework hasn’t started yet, we need to preserve the chance that it might be green 1.

<h3>Player Response:</h3>
<p>{'reason': 'Player +1 holds a single rank 2 among their cards (Y5, G1, Y3, Y2, Y4), and since the yellow firework is currently at 1, the yellow 2 (Y2) is immediately playable. Giving a rank 2 hint to Player +1 will let them identify and play that card to advance the yellow stack, which is a critical move given our limited tokens.', 'action': 21}</p>

<h3>Player Response:</h3>
<p>{'reason': 'We are out of info tokens, so giving a hint is not possible. Looking at our hand, card 4 is the only one with a high chance of being immediately playable. It is known as a 2 and its possible identities are {R, Y, G, W, B}2. Given the board, Y, G, W, and B all require a 2 (Y stack is at 1, G at 1, W at 1, and B at 1) while only R2 would be dead since R already has a 3. That gives an 80% chance that card 4 is playable. With 2 life tokens remaining, this risk is acceptable, and playing it would advance one of the fireworks. Thus, the best move is to play card 4.', 'action': 8}</p>

<h3>Player Response:</h3>
<p>{'reason': 'We have 0 info tokens and need one to help our teammates (for example, to alert Player +1 or +2 about their immediately playable cards, such as the white 2’s or yellow 3’s). None of our cards is known to be clearly safe to play, so we must discard to regain an info token. Evaluating our hand, Card 2 (known as green) has a 33% chance of being the needed green 2, so we prefer to keep it. Card 1 has about a 22% chance of being playable (if it turns out to be white 2 or blue 2). Cards 3, 4, and 5 each only have roughly a 20% chance of matching the exact needed number (green 2 for Card 3; red 4, yellow 3, white 2, or blue 2 for Cards 4 and 5), making them slightly less promising. In particular, Card 3 already shows a green hint (and its possibilities are G1, G2, G3, G4, or G5); since only G2 is playable and the other possibilities (G1, G3, G4, G5) would not safely advance the green stack, it has a lower chance of being immediately useful. Therefore, discarding Card 3 is our safest option to recover an info token and set up a well-informed hint on our next turn.', 'action': 2}</p>
