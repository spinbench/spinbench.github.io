In contrast, card3 (and similarly card4) has no hint information and its possibilities (RYGWB2345) include very few scenarios in which it would be immediately playable (only red3 or yellow2 would work, each with about a 5% chance).

Evaluating our hand, Card 2 (known as green) has a 33% chance of being the needed green 2, so we prefer to keep it. Card 1 has about a 22% chance of being playable (if it turns out to be white 2 or blue 2). Cards 3, 4, and 5 each only have roughly a 20% chance of matching the exact needed number (green 2 for Card 3; red 4, yellow 3, white 2, or blue 2 for Cards 4 and 5), making them slightly less promising. In particular, Card 3 already shows a green hint (and its possibilities are G1, G2, G3, G4, or G5); since only G2 is playable and the other possibilities (G1, G3, G4, G5) would not safely advance the green stack, it has a lower chance of being immediately useful.
