Evaluating our hand, Card 2 (known as green) has a 33% chance of being the needed green 2, so we prefer to keep it. Card 1 has about a 22% chance of being playable (if it turns out to be white 2 or blue 2). Cards 3, 4, and 5 each only have roughly a 20% chance of matching the exact needed number (green 2 for Card 3; red 4, yellow 3, white 2, or blue 2 for Cards 4 and 5), making them slightly less promising. In particular, Card 3 already shows a green hint (and its possibilities are G1, G2, G3, G4, or G5); since only G2 is playable and the other possibilities (G1, G3, G4, G5) would not safely advance the green stack, it has a lower chance of being immediately useful.
