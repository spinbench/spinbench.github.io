        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "Excellent! I'm ready to step into the role of a Hanabi master. The game, as you described, is all about teamwork, careful communication, and sequencing the fireworks correctly. Let me briefly recap our core strategy principles based on the rules:\n\n1. The game’s goal is to complete sequences (1–5) for each of the five colors.  \n2. We must manage our Life Tokens and Info Tokens, using hints wisely to ensure everyone knows which cards are safe to play, while minimizing risks.  \n3. Discarding can be a useful way to regain Info Tokens, but we must be careful not to discard cards needed to complete a firework.  \n4. Since players can see each other’s cards but not their own, hints become the critical information bridge.\n\nAs a master, I’ll help guide our decision-making by advising on:\n• When to give hints versus when to play or discard.  \n• Determining if a card is safe to play based on the visible information in other players’ hands and the current state of our fireworks.  \n• Managing the Info Tokens and Life Tokens effectively—remember, an incorrect play costs a life token, and running out of life tokens means game over.\n\nTo begin, please provide me with our current game scenario. For example, let me know the following:\n• How many Life Tokens and Info Tokens remain.  \n• The progress for each firework (e.g., Red firework’s highest card played is 1, Blue is 0, etc.).  \n• Any key observations from the discard pile.  \n• The cards or hints (if any) that you and your teammates are aware of in your hands.\n\nOnce we have that state information, I’ll advise on the optimal move (whether to play, discard, or give a hint) and the reasoning behind it. Let’s work together to maximize our score and complete those fireworks!"

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "Great! As a Hanabi master, I can walk you through both strategic principles and specific in‐game decision-making using the rules and state details you've provided. Let’s break it down:\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Understanding Our Resources\n\n• Life Tokens: These are precious. Every misplayed card costs us a life. With fewer lives, we must play extremely cautiously.\n  \n• Info Tokens: We use these for hints. If we run out of info tokens, our only option is to discard to regain one. Great information management is key.\n\n• Fireworks: Each color must be built in strict numerical order from 1 to 5. Knowing which cards are already played in a color helps decide what’s safe to play.\n\n• Discards: Once a card is discarded, we lose the chance to ever play it. Keep an eye on these, especially for cards that are rare or critical to complete a firework.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Types of Actions and When to Use Them\n\nA. Giving a Hint  \n – Purpose: Remove uncertainty from your teammate’s choices.  \n – Strategy:  \n  • If you see that one of your teammate’s cards is immediately playable (e.g., the next required card in a firework), give them a hint about either its color or number.  \n  • Prioritize hints that cover multiple cards if possible. For example, if two cards in a teammate’s hand share a color that is onto its next playable card, reveal both positions.\n – Restrictions: Only mention details (color or number) that are present in the target player’s hand. No extra information is allowed!\n\nB. Discarding a Card  \n – Purpose: Free up a card that you suspect is unlikely to be needed soon and to regain an info token if you're low.\n – Strategy:  \n  • If you realize that one or more of your cards are unlikely to ever be needed (for instance, a duplicate that’s already been played or discarded), it might be a safe discard.\n  • Always check the discard pile first – sometimes a card you see in the discard is no longer available for play, so chances to play the remaining copies diminish.\n – Note: When you discard, you are also indirectly communicating that the card is not immediately useful.\n\nC. Playing a Card  \n – Purpose: Advance a firework.\n – Strategy:  \n  • Only play a card if you are confident (either through hints given by your teammates or your reasoning from what you can see in their hands) that it’s the next number needed in its color’s sequence.\n  • If you’re uncertain about a card’s identity and lacking hints on it, it might be safer to request information rather than risk losing a life.\n – Risk: Making an illegal play costs a life token, so this move must be based on solid information.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. In-Game Example Scenario\n\nImagine this game state (for illustration):\n\n • Life Tokens: 3  \n • Info Tokens: 6  \n • Fireworks: Red = 1, Yellow = 0, Green = 2, White = 0, Blue = 0  \n • Discards: A few extra copies of Red 1 and Blue 3 have been discarded.\n\nNow, suppose you are holding several cards you cannot see, but you notice, on your teammate’s board, a Green card that isn’t yet played and it happens to be the next needed (green 3, since green is at 2 on the firework). In this situation, you might use your turn to give them a hint:\n – If they have a green card (you see it in their hand) and no conflicting information, you tell them “Your second card is Green.”  \n – This hint signals that the card could be the playable green 3 (if that’s what it is). If context or previous hints make it obvious that it carries the number 3, they can confidently play it.\n\nConversely, if you’re holding a card that you think is not imminently useful (perhaps because multiple copies are still available or it’s of a color that isn’t in immediate sequence), you might decide to discard it to recover an info token and allow for more communication later on.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Coordination and Signal Refinement\n\n• Use Hints Strategically:  \n – Don’t just say “You have a 1” if it’s already common knowledge that you should play a 1 in a new color.  \n – Try to focus on what matters for progression. Often, hinting about cards that are immediately playable or that avoid the risk of discarding a critical card can be the difference between success and failure.\n\n• Managing Turn Order:  \n – Since after the deck is exhausted each player gets a final turn, planning towards the endgame is critical.  \n – Ensure that hints are used not only to advance the game state but also to prevent an accidental misplay in those critical final moments.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Final Thoughts\n\nThe beauty of Hanabi lies in balancing risk and caution, as well as in efficiently communicating with limited signals. Whether you’re deciding to hint, discard, or play, keep track of what’s already been played, what has been discarded, and the common signals you might have built up with your teammates over previous rounds.\n\nIf you’d like to walk through a specific game state or a complex decision, feel free to describe the scenario, and we can analyze the best move together. Happy playing, and may your fireworks light up the night!"

Discarding it is our best way to gain an info token without risking one of our potentially more useful cards. Therefore, we will discard card 4 to regain an info token for future critical hints.\", \"action\": 3}"

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks.
