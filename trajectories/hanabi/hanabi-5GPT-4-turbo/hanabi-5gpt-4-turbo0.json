        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "As a master of Hanabi and taking my turn, I must consider the current state of the game and assess the board and my teammates' hands to strategically decide which action to take—either giving a hint, discarding a card, or playing a card. \n\n### Analyzing the Game State\n\n1. **Life Tokens**: How many do we have left? This will influence riskier plays.\n2. **Info Tokens**: Do we have enough info tokens to provide a hint? If not, discarding might be necessary.\n3. **Fireworks**: What is the current progress for each color? This helps identify which cards are safe to play and which hints could be most beneficial.\n4. **Discards**: What cards have been discarded? This information is crucial to know what is still playable.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\n\n- If a teammate has a card that I know can safely be played (for example, if I see they hold a Blue 2 and the Blue 1 is already played), I might decide to play a card from my hand if I am confident about its identity (perhaps from previous hints).\n- If we are low on Info Tokens and I’m unsure about any playable cards in my hand, discarding a less useful card (like a duplicate or a card with a high number far from being playable) to regain an Info Token could be a wise move.\n- If I see confusion among the team regarding their hands or critical cards needed soon (like starting a new color or a low-number card after several discards of that number), giving a precise hint could help align efforts and ensure correct plays.\n\n### Example Actions:\n\n- **Give a Hint**: If I notice a player has multiple cards of the same color that are needed soon, I could use an Info Token to hint about that color. This helps the player prioritize which cards to consider playing or retaining.\n- **Discard a Card**: If my hand contains a high-value card that cannot yet be played (e.g., a Red 5 when Red 2 is the highest on the board), discarding could be smart to replenish Info Tokens, assuming we have enough Life Tokens to absorb an accidental future mistake.\n- **Play a Card**: If prior hints have guided me about a particular card in my hand (like knowing I have a Green 2 and Green 1 is on the board), playing that card could be the best move to advance our score.\n\n### Communicate Effectively Within Rules\n\n- Only give hints that comply with the rules, focusing on either one number or one color.\n- Use the hints to not only guide immediate plays but also to set up future opportunities or protect key cards from being discarded.\n- Remember, every action should work towards completing all fireworks or achieving the highest score possible before the deck runs out or we lose all life tokens.\n\nBy thinking strategically about both the immediate and long-term implications of each choice, I can help guide the team to a successful completion of the game."

Therefore, the playable cards are only those with rank 1.\n\n2. **Visible Cards in Players' Hands**:\n   - Player +4 has two 'R1' cards and a 'Y1', all of which are playable since all colors are at 0.\n   - Player +3 has a 'Y1', also playable.\n\n3. **Hints and Info Tokens**:\n   - You have 8 Info Tokens, providing flexibility in hint-giving without needing to discard immediately.\n\n4. **Critical Plays**:\n   - Giving a hint to Player +4 about the color \"Red\" or the rank \"1\" will help them to play one of the two 'R1' cards, essential for starting the red firework stack. This move uses tokens efficiently by affecting two identical cards.\n\n5. **Optimizing the Hint**:\n   - A hint about the color \"Red\" or the rank \"1\" to Player +4 covers two cards at once, maximizing the effectiveness of the hint and encouraging correct sequencing.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nThe best move is to hint Player +4 about the color \"Red\" to ensure they know they have two 'R1' cards. This makes them aware of the playable cards without ambiguity and aligns with maximizing score opportunities efficiently. This action is chosen over playing one of my unknown cards, as playing without certain knowledge poses a risk of losing a life token.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Reveal color to Player +4 to enable playing 'R1' safely, maximizing the use of hint by covering two cards.\", \"action\": 23}\n```"

        "content": "Given the current game state and the cards in our possession, here's the step-by-step thought process:\n\n### Evaluate Playable Cards in Hand\n1. We know our cards might be rank 1 (as indicated by the 'X1' hints). Since R1 and Y1 have already been played, the potential for these cards being Green 1, White 1, or Blue 1 is high. Since no firework for G, W, or B has been started, playing a rank 1 card from these colors can safely begin those stacks.\n2. However, we currently have 0 info tokens, which prevents us from giving any hints.\n\n### Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\n1. Looking at Player +4's hand, they have a 'R1' - this is already played so it's redundant. The 'B2' in their hand can be played because 'B1' might be in our hand (hence starting the Blue firework).\n2. Player +3 has a 'Y1' which is redundant as 'Y1' is already played, but they have 'Y2', which can be played immediately as 'Y1' is already on the board.\n\n### Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\n1. Discarding a card to gain an info token would enable future hints which could be crucial, especially since no info tokens are left.\n2. Discarding one of our 'X1' cards is risky without knowing their exact color; however, it may be the safest bet as we are likely holding a playable card of a new firework (G1, W1, B1), still leaving at least two other 1s to start the remaining color stacks.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the lack of info tokens and the fact Player +4 holds a 'B2' which cannot be played until 'B1' is played, our best move is to play one of our rank 1 cards, specifically aiming to start either G, W, or B stack. Since we cannot provide hints, playing a card and hoping it's one of the unstarted color stacks is currently the most constructive action.\n\nBy playing this card:\n- If it is G1, W1, or B1, we will successfully start a new stack.\n- If it incorrectly belongs to R1 or Y1 (which are already in play), we will lose one life token but gain useful information about our hand composition.\n\nThus, considering the strategic importance of progressing in building fireworks and the acceptable risk given current life tokens (3 remaining), here is the proposed action:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Attempting to play one of the rank 1 cards in hopes it is either G1, W1, or B1 to start a new firework stack.\", \"action\": 4}\n``` \n\nThis move reflects a calculated risk to progress the game in absence of info tokens, utilizing existing game clues and the current game state."

However, this player has no specific hints about this card's identity.\n   - Player +3's 'Y1' is explicitly identified and ready to play, boosting the Yellow firework from 1 to 2.\n\n3. **Info Tokens and Strategic Hints**\n   - We only have 2 info tokens. Giving an effective hint to maximize plays is crucial.\n   - The most immediate and beneficial hint would be to Player +1 about the 'G1', ensuring the next play maximizes our score.\n\n### Decision:\n\nGiven these considerations, I will select to provide a hint about the color green to Player +1. This move is strategic as it allows Player +1 to play the 'G1' accurately, contributing to our fireworks without risk, and it utilizes the info token efficiently.\n\n- **Action** Chosen: '(Reveal player +1 color G)'\n- **Reason**: This hint enables Player +1 to immediately play their Green 1, starting the Green firework, which is currently at 0. This action uses our limited info tokens strategically, ensuring a play that directly contributes to our score, preserving our life tokens.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"This hint enables Player +1 to immediately play their Green 1, starting the Green firework, which is currently at 0.

Providing a rank hint will enable Player +1 to play this card confidently on the next turn.\n- **Available Actions**: The actions associated with revealing rank to Player +1 are limited in the legal actions list, meaning the most direct way to enable the play of 'W2' through a color hint might be absent. However, giving a hint about 'W2' by confirming its color (even though already hinted) can reaffirm its importance, keeping focus.\n\nGiven that 'W2' can be directly played and boosting the White stack is urgent to progress other cards (like 'W3' and 'W4' visible in Player +4's hand), the best action under current constraints is:\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Reinforce knowledge of the W2 card in Player +1's hand to ensure it is played next, aiding in the progress of the White stack.\", \"action\": 11}\n```\n\nThis action uses the remaining info token to help ensure that a firework is built without risking a guess play from my unconfirmed hand."

There's also only 1 info token, meaning giving a hint should be very strategic to make the most impact.\n\n2. **Fireworks Progress**:\n   - **Red**: 1 (can play R2)\n   - **Yellow**: 1 (can play Y2)\n   - **Green**: 1 (can play G2)\n   - **White**: 2 (can play W3)\n   - **Blue**: 0 (can play B1)\n\n### Analyzing Visible Hands:\n\n- **Player +2 has a 'Y2'** which is immediately playable and will progress the Yellow firework to 2. However, the player might not be aware that it is the 'Y2'.\n\n### Strategic Choice:\n\nGiven we have 1 info token, and Player +2's 'Y2' can be played immediately to safely increase the score without risking our last life token, the most impactful action would be to ensure that Player +2 is aware they hold a Y2. This can be done by giving a rank hint, which directly targets the Y2, ensuring clarity and preventing any ambiguity that might result from a color hint considering they also hold a Y4.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n\n- **Reveal rank 2 to Player +2**. This hint will make Player +2 aware of the rank 2 card, which is 'Y2' and is immediately playable. This action uses the last info token wisely by enabling a direct score increase and is safe given our critical life token situation.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Reveal rank 2 to Player +2 to ensure they know they possess a playable Y2 which advances the Yellow firework safely.\", \"action\": 34}\n```"

The next playable card in a critical sequence should be highlighted, especially since incorrect plays result in losing the game at this point due to only having 1 life token left.\n\n3. **Discard Option**: Discarding to gain more Info Tokens might seem appealing, but with the high risk associated with not being able to correct critical errors due to life tokens' restriction, this option should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.\n\n### Chosen Action\n**Giving a hint to Player +1 about `Green`**: This is a strategic action as it solidifies Player +1's knowledge about their hand, directly enabling them to play `G1` confidently in their next turn. This increases the points without the risk of losing the game, and helps to move toward completing the Green stack.\n\nHere's the chosen action formatted as specified:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Providing a hint to Player +1 about the color Green will enable them to play G1, which is immediately playable and progresses the Green fireworks without risk of error, preserving our limited life tokens.\", \"action\": 10}\n```\n\nThis action utilizes our last available Info Token effectively by directly facilitating a score-increasing move, avoids risky plays with unclear cards in your hand, and strategically preserves the life tokens by preventing wrong plays."

        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "Let's begin strategizing our approach to this game of Hanabi. Based on the given state representation and considering that you cannot see your own cards, here is a step-by-step thought process on how to proceed effectively during your turn, optimizing the play based on the information available:\n\n### Understanding the Current Game State\nFirst, evaluate the information provided:\n- **Life Tokens:** Monitor how many mistakes can still be afforded.\n- **Info Tokens:** Knowing how many hints can be given is crucial for planning.\n- **Fireworks:** Review the progress on each color to understand which cards are safe to play and prioritize.\n- **Discards:** Checking what has been discarded can help deduce what is left in the deck and possibly in the hands.\n\n### Decision Making\nDuring your turn, choose between three actions based on the game state:\n1. **Give a Hint (If Info Tokens Available)**\n   - Prefer to give hints that maximize the number of plays or discards derived from the hint.\n   - Choose to hint about a color or number that helps clarify or confirm multiple cards in a teammate’s hand.\n   - Remember to hint cards that are playable immediately or very soon to progress fireworks quickly.\n\n2. **Discard a Card (If Lacking Info Tokens or Unsure Moves)**\n   - Ideal if you suspect your card isn’t immediately useful or if the game has many Info Tokens left.\n   - Discard lower value cards that appear abundant in the discards or in visible player hands, reducing the risk of discarding a crucial card.\n   - Discarding also regains an Info Token which is essential for giving more hints.\n\n3. **Play a Card (If Confident About the Card)**\n   - You should play a card if you are confident, based on previous hints, that it accurately fits into the fireworks.\n   - Playing correctly adds to the fireworks score, crucial for game success.\n   - Incorrect plays lose a Life Token, so certainty is key before attempting this.\n\n### Communication and Team Strategy\n- Use every hint effectively; ensure each hint provides new or clarifying information.\n- Keep track of which cards you have been hinted about. These are likely to be important either for playing or holding.\n- Work collaboratively to determine the risk level. Sometimes it's worth playing a potentially correct card to avoid running out of moves, especially towards the end of the game.\n\n### Advanced Strategies\n- Use known discards to infer what remains in the deck, adjusting your play/hint strategy accordingly.\n- Analyze the risk and reward of playing potentially correct cards based on the current state of fireworks and remaining cards.\n- Calculate not just the immediate effect of your action, but also how it sets up future players.\n\n### Following Through\nWith a clear view on what your teammates hold, use every turn to either advance the fireworks directly or enable teammates to do so in their turns. Remember, Hanabi is about maximizing score collectively, not just individually. Always be planning a few moves ahead and stay adaptable based on how the game evolves.\n\nIt's your turn! Look at the teammates' cards, assess the game state, consider your options, and take the most effective action towards achieving the highest score. Good luck!"

        "content": "Based on the current game state and the cards in the hands of the players, the most beneficial move seems to be facilitating a correct card play by giving a hint. Analyzing the status of the fireworks and the visible cards, playing the 'Y1' from Player +3 is immediately beneficial as it starts the Yellow firework, which is currently at zero.\n\nHere's the thought process:\n\n1. **Firework Progress and Playable Cards**: The Yellow firework stack is at 0, meaning a 'Y1' can be played. Player +3 has a 'Y1' visible and knows its color and rank, making it fully identifiable and ready to play.\n\n2. **Current Info Tokens**: There are 3 info tokens available. Giving a hint costs one token, which is sustainable at this point since we still have a few tokens left.\n\n3. **Strategic Hint Use**: Confirming the 'Y1' for Player +3 who already knows both color and number may seem redundant, but considering the entire game strategy, it's crucial to prompt the player for a guaranteed correct play without ambiguity or hesitation. \n\n4. **Action Choice**: The next immediate playable card after 'Y1' is 'Y2' which Player +2 holds. A hint for color Yellow to Player +2 would ensure that they know about their 'Y1' and 'Y2'.\n\nConsidering these points, the best action is to reveal the color Yellow to Player +2, making them aware of 'Y1' and 'Y2'.

However, considering the duplicates and distributions in other players' hands can offer a clue. \n\n     For example, noticing several high numbers might suggest lower risk in discarding a possibly low card. Without any specific hints about your cards, this remains speculative but necessary due to the zero info tokens and the need to advance the game strategically.\n\n## Chosen Action:\nDiscarding a card seems the safest and most useful action as it will provide an info token which is crucial for future plays and hints. Since there is no basis to choose one card over another, I'll choose the first card (position 0) to keep it simple.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Chose to discard a card to gain an Info token, enabling future hints since no cards in my hand have been identified and risking a blind play could cost a life token.\", \"action\": 0}\n``` \n\nThis action increases our chances of giving useful hints in the next round and helps avoid making an incorrect play that would cost a life token, which we can't afford given we only have two left."

        "content": "Based on the current game state and the visibility of the other players' cards, the next steps need to be strategic. Here's a thoughtful analysis to maximize our score:\n\n## Analysis of the Game State\n- **Fireworks Progress**: Only R and Y fireworks have been started. All other colors are untouched.\n- **Remaining Life Tokens**: With only 2 life tokens, it's crucial to avoid mistakes.\n- **Info Tokens**: Only 1 info token is available, making it essential to use it effectively or regain one soon.\n- **Discard Options**: Analyzing discard viability based on current knowledge.\n\n### Your Hand:\n- You have a possible playing card in the green series. However, you can only guess that they might be G1, G2, G3, G4, or G5 based on your hints.\n\n### Teammates' Hands:\n- **Player +1's hand**: Contains playable card 'Y2' (since Y1 is in the discard and Y1 has been played), but they know it might be yellow. Y4 can’t be played because Y3 hasn't been played.\n- **Player +2's hand**: Their 'Y1' card can be immediately played since it matches the current Y stack's need.\n\n## Optimal Action:\n1. **Playing a Card from Your Hand**: It’s risky without complete knowledge. Your only known cards are green, which hasn't started yet. Avoid playing a card.\n2. **Giving a Hint**: With only 1 info token, it is necessary to use this token to either protect a valuable card or enable a definite play.\n   - **Player +2** has a 'Y1', which is crucial to play next; they already know it's yellow and rank 1.\n3. **Discarding a Card**: A possible action to regain an Info token. However, if you discard a green card that could potentially be G1, this could set back future plays.\n   \n### Strategic Hint:\nYou will **reveal the color yellow to Player +1** using the action identifier. This will confirm all the yellow cards in their hand, enabling them to understand the playability sequence and potentially leading them to play 'Y2', followed by setting 'Y4' as a future play after 'Y3' is found or played. This maximizes the information each player holds and guides towards more efficient future plays.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Revealing yellow to player +1 enables immediate playing of 'Y2', aligning with our current needs and maximizing the use of our limited info token to facilitate correct plays\", \"action\": 9}\n``` \n\nThis decision not only helps progress the fireworks for immediate points but also optimizes the use of our very limited resources (info tokens), focusing on contributing to the clear and safe advancement of the game given the apparent risks and benefits."

They, however, do not know the identity of this card.\n- **Others:** Some cards like 'G2' and 'Y2' seem potentially playable soon but their holders lack full information to play them confidently.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nGiven the single Info Token available, the highest impact action would be enabling a direct play on a firework stack, namely starting the Blue stack. Player +1 holds 'B1' but does not know its identity. Revealing it could secure a sure play, maintaining all life tokens and progressing the game positively.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the current conditions, the best move would be to reveal the color of 'B1' to Player +1, enabling them to safely play this card on their turn. This starts the blue stack which is currently at zero and is a sure play.\n\nHere’s the JSON representation of my decision:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Reveal the color Blue to Player +1 enabling them to play 'B1', thus starting the blue firework stack.\", \"action\": 12}\n```\n\nThis action utilizes the available Info Token efficiently and sets up a guaranteed correct play, helping to advance the game while maintaining life tokens."

Without specific numerical hints, the risk of playing any is high, especially with only 2 life tokens left.\n\n2. **Hinting Option**:\n   - Currently, you have **0 info tokens**, so you cannot give a hint.\n\n3. **Discarding to Gain Info Tokens**:\n   - A good option to consider, as it allows for future hints and makes the next turns more strategic and informed.\n   - Preferably, discard a card that you have least information about or appears least immediately useful, yet doesn't risk losing the game by discarding a critical unseen card.\n\n4. **Check Immediate Playability**:\n   - **Player +1’s Y2** is playable and can advance the Yellow stack to 2.\n\n### Recommendation:\n- You should **prompt Player +1 to play their Y2**. Since you currently have no info tokens and cannot give hints, the only remaining actions are discarding or playing.\n\n   - **Action (Play 0)**: Since there is a need to be cautious due to limited life tokens and a lack of hints, the best action from your hand is risky due to unknown numbers. However, if you must play, considering your cards were identified only by color and not specific enough, playing one of them (especially a Green or White, which you are hinted to have multiples of), might still be relatively safer. Yet, the exact action would need you to specify which Green or White.\n\nGiven your options:\n- **Discarding seems the most sensible to gain an info token**. You can discard one of your Green cards (since you have three hinted as Green). This would help to regain an info token and encourage detailed and helpful hinting in the next rounds.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nI'll recommend **Discarding Card 0**, which is the first card known to be Green. This is because G1 has already been played, reducing the riskiness of discarding a card possibly being G2, G3, G4, or G5, although these are still potentially useful. But the gaining of an info token is crucial now for effective coordination in following rounds.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Discarding to gain an info token, considering limited hint possibilities and the need to avoid risking lives with uncertain plays. Card 0 is chosen as it seems to be one of multiple green cards and loses fewer potential fireworks advancements compared to others.\", \"action\": 0}\n```"

        "content": "To make the most strategic decision in this round, we will analyze the potential plays based on the state of the game:\n\n### Evaluating Your Hand:\n- **Card 0 (W, possible W1-W5)**: With the White stack currently at 1 and possible cards ranging W1-W5, playing your White card could safely be W2 to progress the White stack.\n  \n- **Card 1 and Card 2 (both G, possible G1-G5)**: Green stack is at 1, so playing a G2 would be the next logical step. However, without knowing the specific identity beyond the color, playing either of these cards carries a risk.\n\n- **Card 3**: No hints about this card; therefore, it's too risky to consider playing it.\n\n### Assessing Teammates’ Hands:\n- **Player +1**:\n    - ‘Y2’ is known and playable as the Yellow stack is at 1 (safe to be played).\n    - ‘B4’ and ‘B5’ might later be useful, but currently, the Blue stack is at 0, and neither can be played until at least B1 and B3 are played.\n   \n- **Player +2**:\n    - ‘W2’ could directly help the White stack which is currently 1, but this player doesn't know the card’s identity.\n\n- **Player +3 and Player +4** do not have immediately playable cards considering the stack requirements.\n\n### Discarding for Info Tokens:\nGiven the zero info tokens and only one life token remaining, discarding for gaining an info token is critical. Discarding a less critical card from your hand could be wise to regain an info token for future turns. However, since the game is tight with only 1 life token, we must be very careful.\n\n### Strategic Action Considerations:\n1. **Playing W2 from your hand (Card 0)** is a good option as it extends the White firework without taking any risk of losing the last life token.\n   \n2. **Discarding a less critical card**, like Card 3 where you have no information, would regain an info token. However, considering the need for every point possible and the risk of discarding a potentially valuable card unknowingly, this is less preferable.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlaying the White card from your hand (Card 0) that is likely W2 makes the most strategic sense because:\n- It progresses the fireworks safely.\n- It minimizes risk without wasting an action on a blind discard especially with only 1 life token left.\n\nHere is the decision formatted correctly for the game:\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Playing W2 from position 0 is a safe move to advance the White firework stack from 1 to 2, and no info tokens are needed or risked in this play.\", \"action\": 4}\n```"

        "content": "Based on the current game state and the available options, we need to carefully consider our next move. With only 1 life token remaining, making a mistake in playing a card could end the game prematurely. Here is the step-by-step reasoning leading to the most appropriate action:\n\n### Evaluation of Immediate Playability\n- The fireworks' progress is: **R1, Y1, G1, W2, B0**.\n- In your hand, you have two cards hinted as green (G1, G2, G3, G4, G5). Given the green stack is at G1, it's too risky to play these without knowing the specific rank.\n\n### Considerations for Teammates\n- Player +1 has `Y2` which can be immediately played as the Yellow stack is at Y1. Also, they have `Y4` but it is not immediately playable.\n- Player +1 also has `B2`, but the Blue stack is at B0; hence B2 cannot be played yet.\n  \n### Assessing Discards to Gain Info Tokens:\n- You have 0 info tokens. Gaining tokens is crucial for providing hints to guide correct plays, especially as the deck is dwindling.\n\n### Discard Choices:\n- **Card 3** and **Card 4** in your hand are complete unknowns with potential identities covering all colors and almost all ranks. Since you have no hints on these, and with the set of possible identities being large, discarding one of these is a safer bet than risking a play.\n  \n### Selected Action:\nGiven the current state:\n- There is a high risk associated with playing either of your green hinted cards without knowing their exact ranks.\n- Discarding one of the completely unknown cards (Card 3 or Card 4) seems prudent to gain an information token, which is critically needed given the 0 info tokens currently available. This lets you enable future plays by giving hints in the upcoming turns.\n\nConsidering these points, the best move currently would be to discard Card 3 to regain an info token while avoiding playing an incorrect card which could end the game due to the last life token.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Discarding Card 3 to gain an info token while minimizing risk of ending the game by playing a wrong card.\", \"action\": 2}\n```"

The green stack is currently at G1, so cards G2-G5 are potentially playable if correctly identified.\n\n2. **Player +4's Hand**\n   - An essential observation is Player +4 holds a 'G2' which could be played immediately since the green stack is at G1. This would ensure progress without risking a mistake.\n\n3. **Risk of Playing from Your Hand**\n   - Playing either of your green cards without knowing the exact rank is risky, especially given the very low life tokens (only 1 left). Playing a wrong card would result in immediate game loss.\n\n4. **Discard for Info Token**\n   - With no info tokens left, generating one is critical. However, discarding carries the risk of discarding essential cards needed to complete the fireworks.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that no hints can be given (0 info tokens), the most plausible actions are playing a known correct card from another player’s hand or discarding one of your cards that you believe is least likely to be immediately useful but this isn't without risk. In this case, the safest and most strategic move you can make is encouraging a play from another player that is guaranteed to be correct.\n\n### Recommended Action:\nEncourage Player +4 to play 'G2', which is a guaranteed correct move and progresses the game without risking a mistake. Since you cannot directly make this action happen and cannot use an info token to hint, you must indirectly cause this by choosing from available options that affect your hand:\n- Discard one of your cards to regain an Info Token for future turns, which is the only viable option without directly playing or hinting.\n\nI will choose to discard the card least likely to be immediately useful which could be Card 3 or Card 4 as they do not have any known helpful information and are completely unidentified, making them riskier to play directly.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Discarding an unidentified card to regain an Info Token for strategic hints in future turns, especially since safe plays and exact card identities are unknown due to lack of specific hints.\",\n  \"action\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThis action, while not directly advancing the fireworks, sets the team up for better-informed plays in the subsequent rounds, which is critical with the game nearing its end and with only 1 life token remaining."

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

        "content": "Given that I'm a virtual assistant in this gameplay scenario, my role would be to provide strategic guidance based on the rules of Hanabi and the current state of the game. Since I cannot directly see your cards or play them, I will focus on giving you strategic advice for optimal moves based on typical gameplay scenarios and the principles of good team communication and card management. Here are some strategic tips:\n\n1. **Prioritize Information Sharing:**\n   - Use your info tokens judiciously to give effective hints. Prefer giving hints that enable immediate play of cards or prevent a player from discarding a valuable card. For instance, if someone can play a card that follows the current sequence on the table, prioritize hinting about that card.\n\n2. **Effective Hinting:**\n   - When you give a hint, try to affect as many cards in the player's hand as possible. For example, hinting a color or number that applies to multiple cards maximizes the utility of that hint.\n   - Consider future plays as well. If hinting about a '2' will eventually help in setting up subsequent plays after a '1' is played, it might be worth it.\n\n3. **Discard Strategy:**\n   - Discard cards when you are relatively sure they are not immediately needed. This often applies to duplicate cards or high-number cards when the sequence for that color is far behind.\n   - Discards also replenish your info tokens, so balance the need for new information with the preservation of key cards.\n\n4. **Playing Cards:**\n   - Play a card only when you're confident it follows the correct sequence on the table. Mistakes cost life tokens, which are precious and limited.\n   - Use the process of elimination and previous hints to deduce what your cards might be.\n\n5. **Observe and Deduce:**\n   - Pay attention not only to the hints you receive but also to the hints given to others and the plays and discards they make. This can give you clues about your own cards and the overall state of the game.\n   - Watch the discards carefully to track which cards are out of play, which can also inform your decisions about riskier plays or discards.\n\n6. **Manage Tokens Wisely:**\n   - Avoid running out of info tokens unless you are sure players can make informed plays without further hints.\n   - Conversely, avoid hoarding info tokens too much, as unused tokens at the end of the game do not contribute to your score.\n\n7. **End-Game Scenarios:**\n   - As the game progresses towards the end, be more aggressive with playing cards to maximize the score. \n   - If you are nearing the end of the deck, shift focus from conserving life tokens to playing as many correct cards as possible.\n\nBy following these strategies, you and your team can work together effectively to maximize your score in Hanabi, navigating the challenges of limited information and communication to create a stunning fireworks display."

        "content": "Based on the current game state, the best move to make involves guiding the play of immediate and safe cards to advance the score. As the initial stacks for all colors are at zero, any '1' cards are currently playable.\n\nFrom the detailed description, Player +2 and Player +3 both have a 'Y1' card in their hands. Since there are no hints directing these players about their 'Y1' cards, and considering that playing '1' cards is critical early in the game to build a foundation for other numbers, giving a hint to ensure these '1' cards get played is crucial.\n\nHere's the strategic rationale:\n\n1. **Immediate Playable Cards in Other Players' Hands:**\n   - Player +2 has a 'Y1' with no hint that it is playable.\n   - Player +3 also has a 'Y1' completely unknown to them.\n\n2. **Hint Maximization:**\n   - By providing a hint, specifically about the color 'Y' (yellow), to either Player +2 or Player +3, both of whom have a 'Y1', you maximize the efficiency of the hint. It informs them about a playable card and possibly confirms the unplayability (at this stage) of other cards.\n\n3. **Info Token Usage:**\n   - You have a good number of info tokens (6 available), so using one for a critical hint is judicious.\n\nGiven that both these players have a 'Y1', I would select to hint to Player +2 about the color 'Y'. This choice is based purely on it appearing earlier in the order, hence allowing for the earliest play of the card and advancing the game. Player +3 can be hinted on the next turn if the tokens permit, to bring another 'Y1' into play quickly.\n\nTherefore, the best strategic action would be to give the \"Reveal player +2 color Y\" hint.\n\nHere's how to formally structure this decision:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Give a hint to Player +2 about the color Y to enable them to play the card 'Y1' which is immediately playable and crucial for building the base of the yellow fireworks stack.\",\n  \"action\": 14\n}\n```"

        "content": "Given the current game state and the hand observations, it's clear that certain moves can directly impact the game's progress favorably. Let's analyze the situation and derive the best possible action:\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Fireworks Progress:** \n   - Red: 1\n   - Yellow: 0\n   - Green: 0\n   - White: 0\n   - Blue: 0\n\n2. **Cards in Hands:** \n   - Your hand has been hinted at containing two yellow cards, but their ranks are unknown.\n   - Player +2's hand contains a 'Y1' which is known to the player and is immediately playable.\n   - Player +3's and Player +4's hands also contain a 'Y1,' but they have not been informed about the rank or color of these cards.\n\n3. **Strategic Consideration:**\n   - We need more info tokens to continue giving useful hints. Currently, only 2 info tokens are available, which limits our ability to communicate effectively about several critical cards.\n\n### Optimal Move:\n\nGiven the visible cards and our current knowledge:\n- **Immediate Playable Card:** In Player +2's hand, the 'Y1' is identified and can be played. However, since each player has partial knowledge of their own cards, you are unable to directly influence this play without giving a hint, which isn't necessary in this case as the player is already informed.\n\n- **Potential Hint to Expand Options:** Both Player +3 and Player +4 have a 'Y1', but they are not aware of its properties. Informing one of them could facilitate an additional Y1 play, setting up the stack better for subsequent cards.\n\n- **Discard for Info Token:** You have two yellow cards with unknown ranks. While it might be tempting to discard one to gain an info token, discarding potentially valuable cards (like a 'Y1') could hinder progress.\n\nGiven these observations, the most impactful move is to ensure that more 'Y1' cards are played without waiting for multiple turns to come back around to those players. Thus, revealing the rank '1' to either Player +3 or Player +4 would be tactically sound. Since Player +4 has higher-rank cards visible ('Y5', 'G5'), an indication about the rank '1' provides safer future play options without risking critical end-game cards.\n\n### Decision:\n**Action:** Reveal rank 1 to Player +3\n- This informs them about their 'Y1', enabling them to play it in their turn and advance the yellow stack quickly.\n- It conserves Player +4's action for potentially playing high-ranking cards later or giving additional hints about critical cards.\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Revealing rank 1 to Player +3 allows them to play 'Y1', progressing the yellow firework and effectively using the limited info tokens to set up immediate scoring opportunities.\", \"action\": 38}\n```"

You have one unhinted card.\n- Player +1 can play 'Y1' and 'Y2' immediately (since Y stack is at 1), but they have a hint only about their color.\n- Player +2's 'R1' is critical as the R stack is at 1. Given that 'R1' is exactly known to Player +2, this card should be played next by them.\n- Other cards that can progress the game (like 'G1' from Player +3 and 'W1' from Player +3) are known for their rank (1) but the color isn't yet identified, so they might hesitate to play them.\n\n**Strategic Move:**\nGiven that we are very low on info tokens (only 1), and there are critical plays that can be made, the best move is to enable the most impactful play, which appears to be the 'R1' in Player +2's hand (since it is the only perfectly known play-ready card). Since this card is fully known to Player +2 ('R1' can be played directly without additional hints), there's no need to waste a hint on it. Instead, focusing on setting up for future turns is crucial.\n\n**Next Best Action:**\nAs 'Y1' and 'Y2' in Player +1's hand are visible to you and directly playable following Player +2's 'R1', hinting about their rank could ensure that Player +1 knows these cards are exactly '1' and '2', and can play them in subsequent rounds, building up the Yellow stack quickly. Player +1 already knows these are yellow cards, so specifying the rank is the missing piece of the puzzle.\n\n**Selected Action:**\n- Give a hint about rank '1' to Player +1, which will confirm to them that their 'Y1' is playable immediately. This uses the last info token but should lead to a sequence of plays that boost the score efficiently.\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Enabling Player +1 to securely play 'Y1' by confirming its rank, thereby facilitating a series of correct plays for Yellow fireworks\", \"action\": 28}\n```\nThis hint will confirm the rank '1' for Player +1, enabling them to contribute immediately on their next turn, and set up 'Y2' as a follow-up play."

        "content": "Given the current state of the game, we have several considerations:\n\n1. **Firework Status**: Red at 1, Yellow at 1, Green at 0, White at 0, Blue at 0. The critical paths to building fireworks are especially for Green, White, and Blue where no cards have been played yet.\n\n2. **Your Hand**: You have potential plays with yellow cards ('YX'), but without knowing their exact rank, the play could be risky unless the rank could be deduced or confirmed.\n\n3. **Team Hands Visibility**: Player +1 has a yellow 'Y1' that matches the current firework stack for yellow (also at 1). Thus, 'Y2' in Player +1's hand is the next sequential play. Player +3 and Player +4 have 'W1' and 'G1' respectively, which are immediate plays since White and Green firework stacks are at 0.\n\n4. **Hints Available**: You currently have 0 info tokens, so no hints can be given this turn. This means maximizing the plays is crucial.\n\n5. **Valid Actions Analysis**:\n   - Playing any of your cards (Action IDs 4, 5, 6, 7) without certain knowledge of their ranks is risky and could lead to losing a life token.\n   - Discarding a card (Action IDs 0, 1, 2, 3) might be the safest action since no info tokens are available to give hints, and gaining an info token would enable strategic hints in the next rounds.\n\nSince discarding is the safest option and would contribute to the strategy by obtaining an info token, this should be your move:\n\n- **Choosing a Card to Discard**: Evaluate the cards in your hand for which you have the least amount of information and which might be least risky to discard. Considering that cards in positions 2 and 4 (both known as 'XX') are completely unknown, one of them could be a candidate for discarding. Given that it's early and firework stacks for some colors are still at 0, discarding a potentially higher number card (which these unknowns might be) could be less risky. Discarding one of them allows us to gain a much-needed info token without risking immediate harm to our ability to complete fireworks.\n\nThus, the logical move is:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Choosing to discard a card to gain an information token, enabling strategic hints in the following rounds. Card selected for discard is chosen on the basis of having the least information and potential playability at this stage of the game.\", \"action\": 1}\n```"

        "content": "Given the current state of the game and observing that there are no info tokens available, a strategic move would involve discarding a card. This will both replenish an info token and avoid the risk of playing a card incorrectly, as we lack sufficient information about most cards in play and have only 2 life tokens left.\n\n### Analyzing your Hand:\n1. **Card Analysis:** \n   - Card 1 & Card 2: Both are hinted as yellow but could be any number from 1 to 5. The only yellow cards that can be safely played are Y2 (since Y1 has already been played and discarded).\n   - Card 3 & Card 4: Both are hinted as blue but could be any number from 1 to 5. Currently, the blue stack is at 0, so only B1 is playable.\n\nGiven that your hand lacks definitive playability information (apart from potential guesses on the yellow and blue cards), discarding one of the blue cards might be a reasonable strategy. B3 has been discarded already, reducing the risk of discarding a needed card for sequential firework building in the blue category. \n\n### Action Justification:\n- **Discarding a Blue Card:** Since B3 is already in the discard pile, discarding another Blue might not heavily impact the potential sequence unless it’s B1 (which is a risk but a considered one under the constraints).\n\n### Chosen Action:\nChoosing an action involves balancing risk, the necessity for more information tokens, and avoiding reducing life tokens. Discarding one of the blue cards, specifically Card 3 or Card 4, seems like the least risky option available while enabling future strategic plays by replenishing an info token. \n\nGiven that discarding does not specify which of the same colored cards to discard when both have similar known info, I'll pick the first blue card in your hand to discard.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Discarding a blue card to gain an info token while minimizing the risk of removing a potentially critical card, as B3 is already discarded and higher numbers are less immediately necessary.\", \"action\": 2}\n```"

Given the fireworks state with yellow at 1, these could potentially be Y2, Y3, Y4, or Y5.\n2. **Card 2 - Blue (BX)**: Since the blue stack is at 0, any blue card numbered B1, B2, B3, B4, or B5 might be playable. However, exact identification is risky without certainty on the number.\n3. **Card 3 - Unknown (XX)**: This card has no hints related to its characteristics, meaning it's highly risky to play or even discard without more information.\n\n### Teammate's Hands and Playable Cards:\n- **Player +1** has a visible Y2 which can be played directly (as the Y stack is at 1). They seem unaware as there's no hint linking this card specifically.\n- **Player +2**'s hand doesn’t immediately suggest any plays without risk given the current stacks.\n- **Player +3** and **Player +4** have some cards that are hinted at but without direct plays seen except the B1 in Player +3's hand (as the B stack is at 0).\n\n### Strategic Action:\nSince there is only 1 info token available, giving a hint is crucial and must maximize impact. Player +1 has a playable Y2 but isn’t aware of it. Revealing this can directly enhance the score without risk of a mistake. Thus, using the last info token efficiently to confirm the play of Y2 held by Player +1 is strategic.\n\n**Action Chosen**: Highlight to Player +1 that they hold a Y2, specifically. This would make them aware of the direct playability of this card.\n\n### JSON Output:\nGiven the need to let Player +1 know about Y2 directly and the presence of action id for revealing color Yellow to Player +1, the choice will be:\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Revealing Y2 to Player +1 enables a guaranteed correct play, increasing our score without using up the life tokens and making use of the final info token strategically.\", \"action\": 9}\n```"

Since Y stack is at 1, you might have Y2. It's risky to play without knowing the exact number.\n     - Card 3 is known to be blue (B), but no specific number is known. The B stack is at 0, so if you have B1, it's playable.\n     - Card 4 has no hints.\n   - **Other Players**:\n     - Player +3 has a visible B1. This is a definite play since B stack is at 0.\n  \n2. **Assessing Immediate Playability**:\n   - You do not have a clear play since B1, which is definitely needed, is visible in another player's hand (Player +3). \n\n3. **Hint Availability**:\n   - Currently, there are 0 info tokens, making it impossible to give a hint this turn.\n\n4. **Discard to Gain Info Token**:\n   - Given the critical need for info tokens and that your Card 4 has no known information which makes it the least risky discard, discarding this card can help gain an info token. This token can then be used in future turns to give critical hints, especially to get Player +3 to play B1.\n\n5. **Action Choice**:\n   - The most beneficial action is to discard a card that is least likely to be immediately useful and which we know the least about for maximal safety. Thus, discarding Card 4 is the optimal choice under the current circumstances.\n\nSo based on this analysis, here is the chosen action formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Discard least known card to gain an info token for future hints, as no clear and safe play is currently available without risking the game with only 1 life token left.\", \"action\": 3}\n```"

Given the circumstances, playing this card is straightforward and will not require an immediate hint.\n\n### Strategic Move Consideration:\n- The most urgent need is to increase the info tokens so that more effective hints can be provided in future turns.\n- Given that life tokens are low (only 1), playing a card incorrectly would end the game.\n\n### Optimal Move:\n1. **Player +2 should play 'G1' as it's clearly identified and matches the current needs on the firework stacks.**\n2. **You could reveal more information to Player +2 about their hand to set up future plays, especially with 'G1' as a guaranteed correct play this turn or the next.** Since 'G1' will be played, informing the player about another key card would be beneficial, like revealing 'W4' which could also be a priority soon given that white is at 2 (but this would be useful if more info tokens were available).\n\nSince my suggestion must be focused on your action and keeping in mind the only info token available, the strategic choice would be to maximize the next turns by enabling a play or setting up hints:\n\n- Consider using the info token to hint about a rank or color in a way that will guarantee safe future plays without risking the last life token. Given the hand analysis, a good choice is to play the 'G1' from Player +2's hand, which is an assured correct move and saves the info token for a crucial hint in future turns if more risk arises.\n\n### Decision:\n**Action**: Let Player +2 play 'G1', which is the correct next move for increasing score without using the hint, saving the hint token for more complex decisions next turn.\n\nGiven your constraints as a non-playing advisor and considering you cannot directly influence other players' actions except through suggestions, your best course of action under the rules provided would be to prepare to give a high-value hint in the next round, such as revealing crucial ranks or colors to players who can play immediately in the subsequent turns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Player +2 has 'G1', which can be played immediately to increase the Green stack from 1 to 2, ensuring a safe play and score increment without risking the last life token.\",\n  \"action\": 6\n}\n```"

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

        "content": "As a master of Hanabi, let's strategize to ensure success in our current game setup. Based on the game state you've given me which includes:\n\n- **Life tokens**: Number of remaining life tokens.\n- **Info tokens**: Number of available information tokens.\n- **Fireworks**: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\n- **Discards**: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nHere's how we can approach our turn:\n\n### 1. Assess the Game State\nFirst, review the fireworks display:\n- Red is at 1, needs a 2 next.\n- Yellow is at 0, needs a 1.\n- Green is at 1, needs a 2.\n- White is at 0, needs a 1.\n- Blue is at 0, needs a 1.\n\nAlso, note which cards have been discarded to anticipate what is still available in the deck or might be in players’ hands.\n\n### 2. Review the Visible Hands\nLook at the cards visible in each player's hand, noting any cards that can be played immediately (e.g., any Red 2, Yellow 1, Green 2, White 1, Blue 1) or if there are any critical cards that should not be discarded (like the last remaining copies of any card, especially if they're 5s).\n\n### 3. Choose an Action\n- **If a playable card is visible in someone’s hand:**\n  - If you have enough Info tokens, consider giving a hint to flag these cards as playable to the holder.\n  - Prioritize hints that can result in multiple cards being identified, such as pointing out all instances of '1' if several can be played.\n\n- **If no immediate plays are available:**\n  - Evaluate which cards to discard. If you are holding any cards that are duplicates of what’s already been played or what’s visible in other players' hands and isn't needed soon, consider discarding to regain an Info token.\n  - Avoid discarding if it's the last copy of any number in a color, especially critical numbers like 1s and 5s.\n\n- **If lacking info tokens and no immediate discard is safe:**\n  - You might have to risk a play if it seems probable based on what's been played and what's visible. This should be a last resort.\n\n### 4. Communicate Effectively\nSince actual verbal/written communication is limited, maximize the use of your hints to communicate:\n- Use consistent logic in your hints so players can start predicting why specific hints are given.\n- Remember that each hint can either point out all cards of a specific color or number, so choose the type of hint that gives the most beneficial information to the team.\n\n### 5. Coordinate with Teammates\nMake mental notes on what your teammates are doing on their turns to predict their strategies and assess what cards they might think they hold. This helps in understanding when to play or discard specific cards based on provided hints.\n\nBy continuously revising your strategy based on new cards drawn and the evolving state of the fireworks, life tokens, and info tokens, you can guide the team to a high score or even a perfect game. Be alert, strategic, and cooperative to excel in Hanabi!"

        "content": "Based on the current game state and the detailed information of each player’s hand, the optimal strategy is to maximize the progression of the fireworks while maintaining a stock of information tokens for future turns. Let's break down the strategic approach step-by-step:\n\n### Current Observation:\n- You have two Yellow cards. Without knowing their ranks, you can't risk playing them yet.\n- Player +1 has a 'Y1' which is playable right now as the Yellow firework stack is at 0.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nSince there's a Yellow 1 ('Y1') in Player +1's hand, it is currently the most straightforward and risk-free playable card that will advance the game. Encouraging Player +1 to play this card is crucial, but there is already clarity about the identity of this card for the player. However, as a double-check and to ensure communication clarity, providing a hint using our last info token to confirm both their 'Y1' cards (even though one is sufficient, hinting system does not allow specifying a single card in this format, and confirming both doesn't harm but reaffirms the playability) would seal this knowledge and encourage the immediate playing of these cards.\n\n### Decision:\nSince there's only 1 hint token left, using it to confirm the Yellow cards might seem redundant; however, it reinforces the confidence for Player +1 to play 'Y1' immediately. The Yellow 1 play aligns perfectly with the current firework needs, and any hint that reinforces the certainty of this action is beneficial. This also sets a clear path for the next few turns with the other players knowing more about their hand without us wasting a discard at this crucial moment.\n\nLet's choose the action to \"reveal color Y to player +1,\" which reinforces the playability of the Yellow 1 in Player +1's hand and ensures the accurate progress of the Yellow firework:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Confirming the identity of the playable Yellow 1 card in Player +1's hand to ensure it is played, maintaining firework progress and using the last info token effectively.\",\n  \"action\": 9\n}\n```"

Since Y stack is at 1 and one Y1 has been discarded, playing this card would result in a failed play, costing a life token. Therefore, it should not be played.\n- **Card 4** is partially known (yellow) but its exact rank is uncertain (Y2345). Playing this card is risky without further information.\n\n### Assess Teammates' Hands for Immediate Plays\n- **Player +2**: Can play 'W1' safely since the White stack is at 0.\n- **Player +4**: Can safely play 'W1' as well for the same reason as above.\n- Both actions would extend the white firework without risk.\n\n### Evaluate Discard Options\n- With a lack of info tokens and a pressing need for them to provide effective hints, discarding might be necessary. However, every card in your hand potentially leads to losing critical cards, given the close stakes of the game (only 2 life tokens left).\n\n### Choose the Action\nSince we have no info tokens and need to create an opportunity for future hints, while also avoiding the risk of a wrong play (particularly with only 2 life tokens remaining), discarding a card to gain an info token is prudent. Among the cards in your hand:\n\n- **Card 0** or **Card 1** might be relatively safer to discard as there is no known crucial information about them unlike Card 3 which is identified as a Y1 (already played and another in the discard), making it critical not to lose another potential Y1 or any 1s at this stage.\n\nThus, a safe and strategic approach is to discard either Card 0 or Card 1. I would recommend discarding Card 0, as it provides the same benefit as discarding Card 1 but without additional information that might distinguish between the two.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Discarding Card 0 to gain an info token, which is critical for giving useful hints in future turns and for avoiding playing wrong cards with only 2 life tokens remaining\", \"action\": 0}\n```"

Needs reevaluation or discard.\n- **Card 3**: Definitely yellow but not Y1. Could safely play if Y2 is the next required in yellow sequence.\n- **Card 4**: Completely unknown.\n\n### Other Players’ Critical Cards:\n- **Player +2**: Holds a W1 and a G1, both of which are needed as none of them have started yet.\n- **Player +3**: Holds a G1, another card that can start the green sequence.\n\n### Strategic Options:\n1. **Playing Card 2 from Your Hand**: This action seems like a Y1, but since Y1 has already been discarded, this needs reassessment or can be marked for discarding.\n2. **Hinting to Player +3**: Giving a hint to Player +3 about the green color could be useful (this costs the last info token), as they hold a G1 that can start the green stack.\n\n### Best Action:\nGiven the low info token situation, gaining more info tokens by discarding is highly beneficial while ensuring the team can still progress. Discarding a known redundant or incorrect card is safer than risking a wrong play with limited life tokens.\n\n- **Action Decision**: Discard Card 2. Though initially marked as Y1, the discard pile contains a Y1 showing that either the card was mislabeled or this hint was misinterpreted. This move will avoid any penalty and help regain an information token to use in future turns for more strategic hints.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Discarding Card 2 as the Y1 has already been discarded.

        "content": "Based on the current game state and analysis of both your hand and your teammates' hands, the best strategic move is to give a hint that maximizes the potential for correct plays in subsequent turns. You have one information token to use for hinting. Here's the detailed analysis leading to the decision:\n\n1. **Review of Firework Progress**: \n   - Red stack is at 1, can be extended with R2.\n   - Yellow stack is at 1, can be extended with Y2.\n   - Green stack is at 0, needs G1 to start.\n   - White stack is at 1, can be extended with W2.\n   - Blue stack is at 0, needs B1 to start.\n\n2. **Assessment of Teammate's Hands for Playable Cards**:\n   - **Player +2** has a 'G1'. This card starts the Green stack and is crucial at this point because no green cards have been played yet.\n   - **Player +4** has a 'Y2', which can extend the Yellow stack to 2. This play is also crucial as it builds directly on what has already been played.\n\n3. **Optimal Hint**:\n   - The best use of the hint token is to ensure that crucial cards like G1 and Y2 can be played immediately in the next turns. Hinting either green to Player +2 or yellow to Player +4 would be beneficial.\n   - Since we have only one hint token, and noting Player +2's hand includes a 'G1' which is critically needed to start the Green stack, it's more strategic to use the hint to enable the play of G1 (since green is an unstarted stack and every color needs to reach 5 for a perfect score).\n\n4. **Action Choice**:\n   - Giving a hint to Player +2 about the color green allows for the immediate play of G1, starting the green stack, and possibly setting up future plays if other green cards are drawn. Additionally, this hint might help clarify other greens in their hand (though only G1 is visible currently).\n\nTherefore, the chosen action is to give a hint about the color green to Player +2, enabling the play of G1.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Enable Player +2 to play G1, starting the Green stack, which is crucial as it is the only color stack not yet started.

The needed yellow is Y2, but playing without confirmation could be risky.\n   - Card 2 has no known information and could be any card from RYGWB12345.\n\n2. **Team Cards Analysis**:\n   - **Player +4** holds a 'Y2', which is immediately playable since the Y stack is at 1. This is crucial as it extends the Yellow fireworks.\n\n3. **Info Tokens and Strategic Hint**:\n   - You have only 1 info token, so giving a hint should ideally enable at least one certain play to preserve life tokens and improve efficiency.\n\n4. **Optimal Move Consideration**:\n   - Since Player +4 has 'Y2' and likely is unaware it's playable (depending on previously given hints not detailed here), you should use your info token to confirm this play.\n   - Action '24' corresponds to '(Reveal player +4 color Y)', which would alert Player +4 about the Yellow color, ensuring the playable 'Y2' gets recognized and played.\n\nThis strategic choice leverages your single hint most effectively by enabling a safe play, which not only scores but also avoids potential mistakes given the critical low life tokens scenario. Ensuring Player +4 plays 'Y2' is a move that progresses the game without risking a life token due to an incorrect play.\n\nHere is the suggested action in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Using the hint to confirm the color of Player +4's Y2, which is currently playable and will extend the Yellow fireworks stack without risking a life token.\", \"action\": 24}\n```"

Additionally, there is only 1 info token available, so any hint provided must be of utmost strategic importance to guide a correct play or prevent a critical discard.\n\n### Assessing Cards in Player Hands\nFrom the game state, here's what can be immediately played:\n- **Blue 1 (B1)** from Player +2 can be played since the Blue stack is at 0.\n\n### Ideal Course of Action\nSince playing B1 from Player +2's hand is crucial and it represents a guaranteed point without losing the game due to an error, a hint to Player +2 about the card being blue could be the most valuable action, as it also potentially prevents them from mistakenly discarding it.\n\n### Choosing a Legal Hint\nFrom the provided legal actions, **(Reveal player +2 color B)**, action 17 is the hint that directly informs Player +2 about the presence of the Blue card which they should play.\n\n### Reasoning\nThe choice to give this hint is because:\n1. It secures a guaranteed and safe card play, advancing the score without the risk of losing the game.\n2. It preserves the last life token by avoiding any risky unconfirmed plays.\n3. Stimulating the progression of the Blue stack, which is currently empty and needs to be built.\n\nThis strategy focuses on making a conservative yet progression-oriented move under tight constraints of info tokens and the risk of losing the game. Here is the resulting action in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Direct hint to enable a safe play of B1 in Player +2's hand, maximizing score progression without risking the game's single remaining life token.\", \"action\": 17}\n```"

        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "Alright! Let's strategize the best way to play the game of Hanabi considering the situation you've laid out. Based on the game state you mentioned, it looks like we are early in the game with limited progress on the fireworks. Here's a step-by-step strategy guide to follow:\n\n1. **Assess Fireworks Progress**:\n   - Check which colors are most progressed. In this case, red (R1) and green (G1) have started while yellow (Y0), white (W0), and blue (B0) have not.\n\n2. **Evaluate Your Teammates' Hands**:\n   - Check the visible cards in your teammates' hands to identify which cards can be played immediately or soon.\n   - Prioritize the cards that are essential to continue any started sequences or to start new ones.\n\n3. **Use Hints Effectively**:\n   - If you have info tokens available, use them to hint about crucial cards that can be played. For instance, hinting about a '1' could help start any uninitiated sequences.\n   - Aim to use hints that cover multiple relevant cards in a teammate's hand to optimize the value of each hint.\n\n4. **Consider Discarding**:\n   - If you're low on info tokens and there are safe cards to discard (like extra number '1's after all colors of '1' have been played), consider discarding to regain an info token.\n   - Be cautious about discarding potentially useful cards for future sequences unless you're sure they aren't needed or there are duplicates.\n\n5. **Playing Cards**:\n   - If it's your turn and the team is certain about a card in your hand (through previous hints), play that card.\n   - Mistakes cost life tokens, so ensure the play is correct to avoid penalties.\n\n6. **Manage Tokens Wisely**:\n   - Always keep an eye on the life and info token count. Running out of life tokens ends the game, while running out of info tokens limits strategic options.\n   - Strategically plan when to regain info tokens through discards, balancing this with the need to progress on fireworks.\n\n7. **Long-term Strategy**:\n   - Communicate through your hints about long-term setups, preparing your teammates for future plays.\n   - Plan ahead by considering which sequences need the most help and prioritizing those colors for hints or safe plays.\n\n8. **Watch for End Game**:\n   - As the deck thins, be mindful of the game drawing to a close. Plan final plays and hint strategies to maximize score before the deck runs out.\n   - Ensure that each player maximally utilizes their last turn when the deck is exhausted.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can efficiently cooperate with your team to maximize the score. Remember, the goal is not just to avoid losing but to achieve the highest possible score by completing all the fireworks perfectly. Every move should be thoughtful and aimed at progressing towards this collective goal."

Since the yellow stack (Y) is currently at 0, this card can be safely played to start the yellow fireworks.\n\n2. **Possibility of Other Actions**:\n   - No info tokens are available, hence no hints can be given this turn.\n   - Discarding a card could be considered to regain an info token, but since there is a card that can definitely be played (Y1), playing the card is prioritized over discarding for now.\n   - The other cards in your hand with no certain information or risky potential plays should not be considered for playing this turn.\n\n3. **Teammate's Hands**:\n   - After playing Y1, teammates have multiple cards marked as rank 1, which can be played in subsequent turns (e.g., `Y1`, `W1` in Player +1’s hand, and `G1`).

This card has already been identified as a rank 1.\n\n2. **Consider the Value of Giving Hints:**\n   - Player +1 also has 'W1' which is a playable card but they only know its rank without certainty of the color. Making the color known could directly result in a successful play.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Risk and Necessity of Discarding:**\n   - With only 2 info tokens left, gaining more tokens is essential for continued effective communication.\n   - However, since there is a direct play that can be accomplished with the existing info by hinting, discarding might be less urgent this turn.\n\n4. **Select the Most Effective Hint:**\n   - Hinting the color 'W' to Player +1 will make them aware that their first card is 'W1', enabling them to correctly play it and advance the fireworks.\n\n5. **Plan for Next Actions:**\n   - Following this hint, focus should be placed on building up info tokens and enabling more plays.\n   - Observing future discards from less critical cards might be needed soon to regain tokens for further hints.\n\nBased on these considerations, the best move at this moment would be to hint the color 'White' to Player +1.

        "content": "Based on the current situation in Hanabi and reviewing the options carefully, the most impactful move involves a strategic discard to regain an info token, as currently there are 0 available info tokens. Without the ability to give hints, the communication necessary to ensure correct and safe plays is severely limited.\n\n**Analysis of the Current Cards**:\nLooking at your own hand, none of the cards have been identified, which means playing any card from your hand is highly risky without any hints on their identities. The probability of playing a card correctly is too low, and with only 2 life tokens remaining, a wrong play could push the team closer to losing the game. \n\n**Teammates' Hands**:\n- Player +1 has a known 'G1' which should definitely be played since the green firework is at 0. They also can clearly see it's a 'G1', so they should be aware that it is playable.\n- Other cards in other players' hands are not immediately necessary for play or are risky without further hints. \n\n**Optimal Choice**:\nDiscard a card from your own hand to recover an info token. This action is beneficial as it increases future strategic options by allowing you to give hints on subsequent turns. Choosing which card to discard should be based on the least informational risk. Card 0 in your hand seems the safest to discard based on its possible identities which only consist of colors and numbers already in play or less critical at this stage (e.g., 'GWB2345' - considering green needs a '2' to progress after 'G1').\n\nThus, the optimal action now is:\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Discarding to regain an info token because there are 0 info tokens available, and giving hints is crucial for correct plays in the subsequent rounds.\", \"action\": 0}\n```\nBy discarding, you facilitate more strategic plays in the upcoming turns through regained hints, allowing the team to safely continue building fireworks.\n"

        "content": "Based on the current game state, let's evaluate the best move to make. We have 2 life tokens, and crucially, we're out of info tokens, which means giving hints is not an option at this turn. Therefore, our actions are limited to playing or discarding a card from our hand. Let's analyze the potential impacts of these choices:\n\n1. **Playing a Card from Your Hand:**\n   - Without specific hints on any of your cards and unclear identities, playing a card from your hand risks a mistake, which could cost a life token. Given the lack of information and high risk, this isn't advisable unless absolutely certain.\n\n2. **Discarding a Card:**\n   - Discarding is a safer option since it does not risk a life token and will replenish an info token, which is crucial for future strategic plays and giving hints. Considering all your cards are a complete unknown (possible identities ranging across all colors and numbers), choosing any card to discard is relatively safe in terms of not accidentally discarding a crucial next play (since no card identity is known and no stacks are above 1 except blue, which is at 0).\n\nGiven that any card could potentially be valuable but the risk of playing a wrong card is high, and the immediate need for info tokens to facilitate future plays and hints:\n\nChoosing to discard could be the best option. Discarding from your hand where all cards have the broadest range of possible identities, specifically card 0 or card 3 which both have no known information and are entirely ambiguous, seems like a strategic move. This maximizes the knowledge retained (since no knowledge is currently held about these cards) and minimizes potential loss (as no card is known to be immediately playable).\n\nLet’s proceed with discarding card 3 to gain an information token, which will help in future rounds to provide valuable hints:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Discarding card 3 to gain an information token, enabling strategic hint giving in the following turns and minimizing risk since no card information is known.\", \"action\": 3}\n```"

        "content": "Based on the current state and the cards in players' hands, a careful consideration should be taken as follows:\n\n1. **Current State and Options**:\n   - Fireworks progress: R1, Y1, G1, W2, B0.\n   - Available actions: Discard or play a card from your hand.\n   - Remaining deck: 11 cards.\n\n2. **Assessing Your Hand**:\n   - All your cards lack specific hints about their identity. No safe play can be directly identified from your hand.\n\n3. **Immediate Play Opportunities in Others' Hands**:\n   - Player +1 has a 'B1'. This card is currently playable as the Blue stack is at 0.\n   - Player +2 has a 'G1'. However, since the Green stack is already at 1, this card is not immediately playable.\n\n4. **Critical Observations**:\n   - There are no info tokens left to give hints to other players about the criticality or sequence of their cards.\n   - The only viable actions available are discarding a card from your hand or playing a card. Given your lack of certain information about your own cards, discarding seems to be a safer option unless you can deduce something about your cards based on game progression or discards.\n\n5. **Deciding on Action**:\n   - Discarding a card from your own hand is the most reasonable and safe move, especially given the lack of info tokens. This will not only prevent potentially losing a life token from a wrong play but will also generate an info token that could be crucial in subsequent turns to guide correct plays.\n   - As for which card to discard, without specific hints and a broad possible identity ('RGWB12345' for Card 1 and 'RYGWB12345' for others), opting to discard a card that potentially has a duplicate in the deck or less critical at this moment might be strategic. Given all four cards in your hand have wide possibilities, any of them could be a candidate.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nDiscarding a card where you have the least visibility and potential impact, which in this case is any of your cards, seems rational. However, since you need to choose one, discarding the first card (position 0) would be practical to generate an info token while minimizing risk.\n\n**Action Output**:\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Given the lack of info tokens and uncertainty about my own cards, discarding is the safest option to gain an info token for strategic play in subsequent turns.\", \"action\": 0}\n```"

        "content": "Given the current situation in the game with 1 life token remaining and 0 info tokens available, our primary concern must be to safely continue building the fireworks without risking a wrong play that could end the game. Here's an action plan based on the current game state:\n\n### Evaluate Discard Options for Info Tokens\nSince there are no info tokens left, any hint to direct teammates is not possible until we generate new tokens. Given this, discarding is the most beneficial action at the moment.\n\n### Analyze Risk and Benefit of Discarding a Card\n1. **Your Hand**:\n   - All your cards are unknown, represented as 'XX' with possible identities 'RYGWB12345'. Playing any of these without information is highly risky.\n\n2. **Current Firework Progress**:\n   - R stack at 1\n   - Y stack at 2\n   - G stack at 1\n   - W stack at 2\n   - B stack at 0\n\n3. **Discards and Remaining Cards**:\n   - Observing the discard pile, you can see that some cards are already out of the deck (like Y1, Y5, G5). This might suggest some cards in your hand are less likely to be duplicates and hence riskier to discard.\n\n4. **Teammates' Hands**:\n   - Notably, 'B1' can be played by Player +1 as the B stack is at 0.\n   - 'Y4' can be played soon by Player +3 once Y3 is in play, and since Y3 is in the discard pile, this is critical.\n   - Player +2's 'G1' can be played directly since the Green stack is at 1.\n\n### Decision:\nSince you have no information about your cards, it's safest to discard one to gain an info token while ensuring it has the least impact on future plays. Consider:\n- **Which Card to Discard**: Discard a card from your hand that, based on the plays needed (e.g., focusing on the B and G stacks as B1 can soon be played and G needs progression), might be least impactful. Given the situation, any card might be risky, but since the goal is to get info tokens back, discard the first card in your hand.\n\n### Legal Action:\nAfter considering above points, the best action is to discard one of your cards to regain an info token which is critical for giving hints in subsequent turns.\n\n**JSON Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Discard a card to gain an info token as no hints can currently be given to assist teammates and no safe play is possible without info. Chose the first card to keep options open for other potential useful cards.\",\n  \"action\": 0\n}\n```"
