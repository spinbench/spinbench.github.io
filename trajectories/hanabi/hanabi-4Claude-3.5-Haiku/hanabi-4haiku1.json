        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

You can choose from the following legal actions:\n\nThe legal actions are provided in a mapping of action identifiers to their descriptions:\n{5: '(Play 0)', 6: '(Play 1)', 7: '(Play 2)', 8: '(Play 3)', 9: '(Play 4)', 11: '(Reveal player +1 color Y)', 12: '(Reveal player +1 color G)', 13: '(Reveal player +1 color W)', 14: '(Reveal player +1 color B)', 15: '(Reveal player +2 color R)', 17: '(Reveal player +2 color G)', 18: '(Reveal player +2 color W)', 19: '(Reveal player +2 color B)', 21: '(Reveal player +3 color Y)', 22: '(Reveal player +3 color G)', 23: '(Reveal player +3 color W)', 26: '(Reveal player +1 rank 2)', 27: '(Reveal player +1 rank 3)', 28: '(Reveal player +1 rank 4)', 29: '(Reveal player +1 rank 5)', 30: '(Reveal player +2 rank 1)', 31: '(Reveal player +2 rank 2)', 32: '(Reveal player +2 rank 3)', 36: '(Reveal player +3 rank 2)', 37: '(Reveal player +3 rank 3)', 38: '(Reveal player +3 rank 4)'}\n\n(Reveal player +N color C): Give a hint about color C to the player who is N positions ahead of you.\n(Reveal player +N rank R): Give a hint about rank R to the player who is N positions ahead.\n(Play X): Play the card in position X from your hand.\n(Discard X): Discard the card in position X from your hand.\n\nBased on the annotated state and the list of legal actions, decide on the most appropriate move to make. Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks. Good luck!\n"

Evaluate Playable Cards:\n   - All firework stacks are currently at 0, so no cards can be played yet.\n   - My hand contains unknown cards, so I cannot play anything safely.\n\n2. Hint Opportunities:\n   - Player +2 has some promising cards:\n     * W1 could start the White firework stack\n     * G1 could start the Green firework stack\n     * B2 is potentially playable if a Blue 1 has been played\n\n3. Token Management:\n   - We have 8 info tokens, which is a good amount\n   - We have 3 life tokens, so we need to be careful\n\n4. Strategy:\n   - The best move is to give a hint about the starting cards to help initiate firework stacks\n\nGiven these considerations, I recommend giving a hint to Player +2 about their Green 1 card:\n\n{\"reason\": \"Hint Player +2 about Green 1 to potentially start the Green firework stack\", \"action\": 17}\n\nThis hint will help Player +2 understand they have a potentially valuable Green 1 card that could start the Green firework sequence."

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

Teammates' Hands Analysis:\n   - Player +1 has some potentially playable cards:\n     * W1 can be played on the White stack\n     * Y1 can be played on the Yellow stack\n   - Player +2 has some useful cards:\n     * Y2 could be played if a hint is given\n   - Player +3 has critical cards:\n     * R1 and R2 could potentially help the Red stack\n\n3. Hint Opportunities:\n   - We have only 1 info token\n   - The most strategic hint would be to inform Player +1 about their W1 card, which can definitely be played\n\n4. Token and Risk Management:\n   - We have 3 life tokens, which is low\n   - We want to avoid risky plays\n   - Giving a hint about a definite playable card is the safest move\n\nBased on this analysis, I recommend the following action:\n\n{\"reason\": \"Give a hint to Player +1 about their White 1 card, which can be immediately played to extend the White firework stack\", \"action\": 13}\n\nThe rationale is:\n- It helps progress the White firework stack\n- It uses our limited info token effectively\n- It reduces the risk of a mistake\n- It helps the team move closer to completing the fireworks"

Fireworks Progress:\n   - Red stack is at 2 (needs 3, 4, 5)\n   - Yellow stack is at 0 (needs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n   - Green stack is at 1 (needs 2, 3, 4, 5)\n   - White stack is at 1 (needs 2, 3, 4, 5)\n   - Blue stack is at 1 (needs 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n2. Critical Observations:\n   - We have only 2 life tokens and 1 info token\n   - We need to be very careful about playing cards\n\n3. Hint Opportunities:\n   - Player +3 has an R5 which could be crucial for the Red stack\n   - Player +3 also has two B1 cards, which could help the Blue stack\n   - Some players have cards that could potentially be played\n\n4. Strategy Consideration:\n   - With only 1 info token, we need to use it strategically\n   - Giving a hint about the B1 to Player +3 could help complete the Blue stack\n\nBased on this analysis, I recommend the following action:\n\n{\"reason\": \"Hint B1 to Player +3 to help them identify their playable Blue 1 cards\", \"action\": 24}\n\nThe rationale is:\n- We have a chance to help complete the Blue stack\n- Player +3 has two B1 cards, but doesn't know they are B1\n- This hint provides clear, actionable information\n- It helps the team progress without risking a life token\n- We still have 1 info token, so this is a good use of it"

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

Critical Observations:\n   - We have very few life tokens (2) and info tokens (1)\n   - Some colors need critical plays to progress\n\n3. Playable Cards in Teammates' Hands:\n   - Player +1 has B1 which can be played on the Blue stack\n   - Another B1 in Player +1's hand is also playable\n   - Player +3 has W1 which can be played on the White stack\n   - Player +3 has Y1 which can be played on the Yellow stack\n\n4. Strategy Consideration:\n   - Prioritize helping teammates play their known safe cards\n   - Preserve the last info token for a critical hint\n   - Avoid risking a life token with an uncertain play\n\n5. Best Action:\n   - Give a hint to Player +1 about their Blue 1 cards to ensure they play them\n   - This will help advance the Blue stack and conserve our resources\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll choose to reveal the Blue color to Player +1:\n\n{\"reason\": \"Hint to play both Blue 1 cards, advancing the Blue stack safely\", \"action\": 14}\n\nRationale:\n- Both Blue 1 cards in Player +1's hand can be played\n- This hint helps progress the Blue fireworks\n- Uses minimal information token\n- Avoids risky plays or discards given our limited life tokens"

You can choose from the following legal actions:\n\nThe legal actions are provided in a mapping of action identifiers to their descriptions:\n{0: '(Discard 0)', 1: '(Discard 1)', 2: '(Discard 2)', 3: '(Discard 3)', 4: '(Discard 4)', 5: '(Play 0)', 6: '(Play 1)', 7: '(Play 2)', 8: '(Play 3)', 9: '(Play 4)'}\n\n(Reveal player +N color C): Give a hint about color C to the player who is N positions ahead of you.\n(Reveal player +N rank R): Give a hint about rank R to the player who is N positions ahead.\n(Play X): Play the card in position X from your hand.\n(Discard X): Discard the card in position X from your hand.\n\nBased on the annotated state and the list of legal actions, decide on the most appropriate move to make. Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks. Good luck!\n"

Firework Stacks Status:\n   - Red stack is at 2 (needs a 3)\n   - Yellow stack is at 0 (needs a 1)\n   - Green stack is at 1 (needs a 2)\n   - White stack is at 1 (needs a 2)\n   - Blue stack is at 1 (needs a 2)\n\n2. Critical Observations:\n   - We have only 1 life token left, so we must be extremely careful\n   - We have 0 info tokens, which limits our communication\n   - There are 9 cards remaining in the deck\n\n3. Playable Cards in Teammates' Hands:\n   - Player +1 has R3 which could be played on the Red stack\n   - Player +3 has G2 which could be played on the Green stack\n   - W1 in Player +3's hand could start the White stack\n\n4. Our Hand Constraints:\n   - We have no information about our own cards\n   - Cannot risk playing a card blindly with only 1 life token\n\n5. Strategic Considerations:\n   - We need to help our teammates play safe cards\n   - Giving a hint about a definite playable card would be ideal\n\nGiven these constraints, the best action is to give a hint to help a teammate play a safe card:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reason\": \"Hint Player +1 about Red 3 to help complete Red stack with low risk\",\n    \"action\": 5\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning is:\n- Player +1 has R3 which matches the current Red stack of 2\n- Hinting about the Red color for this card will help them confidently play it\n- This increases our chances of survival and progressing the fireworks\n- Since we have no safe play in our own hand, using a hint is the most strategic move"
