        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

However, since I don't know the rank, playing either could be risky.\n\n### Step 2: Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\nPlayer +1 has:\n- **B1**: This is immediately playable and has been hinted as rank 1.\n- **Y2**: Yellow stack is at 0, so this isn't playable yet.\n- **R5**: Not yet playable since the Red stack is at 0.\n- **R1**: Playable and hinted as rank 1.\n- **W4**: Not playable at this stage since the White stack is at 0.\n\nGiven this, Player +1 has two cards (B1 and R1) that are playable. Ensuring they play these will advance our score swiftly. They already have hints about both cards (rank 1), meaning they may already know what to play. \n\nWith 6 info tokens, we can safely provide more information if needed.\n\n### Step 3: Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\nSince we have plenty of info tokens (6 out of a possible maximum), there's less immediate pressure to discard for tokens. Therefore, giving a strategic hint becomes important.\n\n### Decision:\nI should facilitate Player +1 to make the correct play. Since they may already know their rank 1 cards, it's better to confirm a specific playable card's color to help them confidently play it. Let's hint about color for future precision if needed.\n\nPlayer +1's Yellow card isn't helpful at the moment, and other cards need more plays to become relevant. Hence, let's confirm their B1 color to help them play it and score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"I will give Player +1 a hint about their Blue card to ensure they play B1, which is immediately playable and will advance our Blue stack.\",\n  \"action\": 14\n}\n```"

Current Yellow (Y) stack is 0, so I can play Yellow 1 safely. However, I don't know which one is Yellow 1.\n- **Card 3:** Known info is 'X2'. Current Yellow stack is 0, Green stack is 1, White stack is 1, and Blue stack is 2, so I cannot play a 2 of any color safely.\n- **Card 4:** Known info is 'RX'. The current Red stack is at 1. I need Red 2 next. Without more information, the risk is high.\n- **Card 5:** No known info, hence too risky to play.\n\n### Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities:\n- **Player +1's Yellow 2 (Y2):** This player knows this card's complete identity. \n- **Player +1's White 4 (W4):** Can be played if I provide clarity that White stack needs a 4 to progress (but currently at 1), not immediate priority.\n- **Player +1's Yellow 4 (Y4):** Needs Yellow stack (Y stack) to reach 3 first.\n- **Player +1's Green 3 (G3):** Needs Green stack (G stack) to be at 2.\n  \n### Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens:\n- Discarding may be necessary to provide more clues because only 1 info token remains, which might not be enough for productive gameplay.\n  \n### Decision:\nGiving a hint about Yellow (Y) cards might help Player +1 realize the importance of Y2 and potentially playing it if conditions align soon, but it doesn’t currently help progress directly due to Yellow stack status being 0. Thus, gaining an info token through discarding seems more beneficial for future hinting possibilities.\n\nThus, my chosen move is to discard a card. Given the lack of specific hints or critical needs, it makes sense to discard the card that has the least known information and isn't likely to be immediately useful.\n\nI'm deciding to discard Card 5 as it has no known information and covers a broad range of possibilities.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"With limited info available and no direct immediate play options, discarding can gain an info token for future strategic hints or plays.

        "content": "Here's how I'd approach this turn, step by step:\n\n### 1. Evaluate Playable Cards in Hand\n- **Your Hand Analysis:** \n  - Cards 1 and 2 are both hinted to be Yellow. Since no hints about numbers are given, they can be Y3, Y4, or Y5. None are playable since the Yellow firework stack is still at 0.\n  - Cards 3 to 5 have no hints and could be any color or number. Given the fireworks progress (R1, Y0, G1, W2, B2), none of these cards can be safely played without additional hints.\n\n### 2. Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\n- **Player +1's Hand Analysis:**\n  - **W4**: Cannot be played yet as White is at 2.\n  - **Y4**: Cannot be played since Yellow is at 0.\n  - **G3**: This is potentially playable as Green is at 1.\n  - **B4**: Cannot be played since Blue is at 2.\n  - **R2**: Playable since Red is at 1.\n  \n  Thus, hinting to Player +1 about the Red 2 card is most optimal. This will give them the information needed to play the Red 2, progressing the Red firework stack.\n\n### 3. Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\n- Discarding is risky given the lack of information about useful cards in hand, and we would prefer to use hints to give direct information for immediate progress.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe optimal action is to reveal to Player +1 about their Red card, allowing them to play R2. This move maximizes the chances of making immediate progress on the Red firework stack.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Player +1 holds Red 2, which can be played to progress the Red firework stack. Providing a color hint for Red ensures the card is played correctly.\", \"action\": 10}\n```"

The Yellow stack is at 0, which means we would need Y1 to play next. Therefore, these cards are not immediately playable.\n   - For cards 3, 4, and 5, there are no hints given, so we can't confidently play them.\n\n2. **Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities:**\n   - Player +1 has a 'G3', which is the next needed card in the Green sequence as the Green stack is at 1. This card is labeled with the number 3, so they might know it's playable.\n   - Player +1 also has 'W4', which cannot be played yet (White stack is at 2, and we'd need W3).\n   - To enhance Player +1's decision-making, it could be helpful to provide a more specific hint, if possible, but we have only 1 info token.\n\n3. **Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens:**\n   - Since there are 2 life tokens left and 1 info token, gaining an additional info token might be useful for making future plays or providing critical hints.\n\n**Conclusion and Decision:**\n- The most strategic move would be to discard one of my unknown cards, preferably one with the broadest possibilities and least likely to cause immediate harm. Discarding Card 3 seems reasonable, as it's not hinted at all and the pool of possible cards is large.\n\nTherefore, my chosen action is to discard Card 3 in my hand.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Discarding Card 3 will help gain an additional info token, which can be used for future hints or plays.

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "Playing Hanabi requires strategic communication and careful attention to the game state. Here are some strategies and considerations to guide your moves:\n\n1. **Giving Hints:**\n   - **Efficient Hints:** Try to give hints that are immediately useful for your teammates. For instance, if a player has a playable card (like a '1' of a color that hasn't started), inform them about that card.\n   - **Elimination Hints:** Sometimes, it's helpful to point out what is not in their hand, allowing them to deduce what their cards might be. This can be indirect, but clear patterns of hints can help team members infer their hand compositions.\n   - **Conserve Info Tokens:** Carefully manage info tokens. Give hints when they have a strategic impact, such as allowing a teammate to play a card or make a safe discard.\n\n2. **Discarding Cards:**\n   - **Safe Discards:** Try to discard cards that are least likely to be needed. For instance, duplicates of cards that have already been safely played or are less likely to appear in the sequence.\n   - **Re-gain Info Tokens:** If the team is low on info tokens, prioritize discarding cards to regain info tokens and allow for more hints.\n\n3. **Playing Cards:**\n   - **Play When Certain:** Only play when you are reasonably sure a card can be played without costing a life token. This usually follows a specific hint from another player indicating it is safe to play.\n   - **Manage Risks:** Sometimes, taking a calculated risk can be beneficial, especially if the loss of a life token won’t be critical.\n\n4. **Observation and Memory:**\n   - Keep track of the cards that have been discarded and which cards have been hinted at previously. This helps in deciding which cards are safe to discard or play.\n   - Pay attention to the cards in other players’ hands to deduce the missing numbers/colors.\n\n5. **Team Strategy:**\n   - **Prioritize Starting New Fireworks:** Always try to play or give hints leading to the play of the '1s' of any color not yet started.\n   - **Complete Existing Fireworks:** Once a firework is underway, focus on completing it by playing higher-numbered cards.\n   - **Endgame Strategy:** As the deck nears depletion, focus on maximizing points and ensure that critical cards are not left unplayed.\n\nBeing mindful of your teammates' actions and the overall game state will help maximize the score. Remember, communication is key, and sometimes the absence of a hint or the choice of which card to hint at can be just as informative as the hint itself."

Since the White stack is at 1, this card can't be safely played.\n   - My fourth card (`YX`) could potentially be `Y1`, making it an important card to reveal later but not immediately playable since we can't confirm it's `Y1`.\n   - My fifth card remains completely unknown, making it a poor choice for an immediate play.\n\n2. **Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities:**\n   - Player +1 has `B2`, `Y4`, `Y5`, `G4`, and `W2`.\n   - `B2` and `W2` cannot currently be played because both Blue and White stacks are at 1. \n   - `Y4` and `Y5` are far from being playable since we need `Y1`, `Y2`, and `Y3` first.\n   - `G4` is not useful immediately since Green hasn't started yet.\n\n3. **Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens:**\n   - With 0 Info tokens, it's crucial to gain some. Discarding allows us to gain an info token, which we can use to provide hints in the future.\n   - My fifth card (`XX`, `RGWB1345`) is a good candidate for discarding since any of these possibilities aren't immediately playable, and it covers a range of highly repeated cards that are less likely to be critical at this point.\n\nGiven the current situation, it makes the most sense to discard my fifth card to gain an Info token.

Since discarding is necessary to regain info tokens, choosing a card with less immediate value is prudent.\n- Discarding Cards 2, 4, or 5 seems safest, as they contain unknowns and less critical sequences.\n\n### Choose the Best Move:\nGiven the critical information about R1 in Player +1's hand, providing a hint to reveal this specific card stands as a strategic move, considering the cards in play and the need for info conservation.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Revealing the red R1 in Player +1's hand allows them to play a card that extends the red stack, progressing the game efficiently while preserving life tokens.\", \"action\": 10}\n```"

The yellow stack is at 0, so a 'Y1' is needed, not 'Y2'.\n2. **Card 2**: Possible identities are 'RG345'. Without further information, it's unclear if this card can be played.\n3. **Card 3**: Possible identities are 'W345'. The white stack is at 1, so 'W2' is needed next. This card cannot be played.\n4. **Card 4**: Possible identities are 'Y345'.

The card least likely to be useful soon is the one with high uncertainty.\n\n- **Card 5** is a good candidate for discarding as it has the widest range of identities (RYGWB12345), meaning it's most uncertain and likely less critical based on what you've seen.\n\nGiven that we have 0 info tokens and the need to give a helpful hint about 'R1', discarding a card is the most strategic move to gain an info token and allow for future hint-giving.\n\nHere's the decision based on the above analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Discarding Card 5 is the safest option to gain an info token as this card has the highest uncertainty in identity with no direct hints provided.

Given the uncertain identities of cards in hand and considering the need to avoid crucial loss, we should choose a card that has a low chance of being needed soon.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe highest priority is regaining an info token because there are no immediate safe plays. Card 1 has a relatively wide range but does not have a clear play signal, and discarding it should have limited impact on current fireworks progress since only one copy of each 3, 4, and 5 remains in the game.\n\nThus, the best move is to discard **Card 1** to regain an info token.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Regain an info token by discarding Card 1, as there's no clear play and we cannot provide clues with 0 info tokens.\",\n  \"action\": 0\n}\n```"

Since the White stack is at 2, we cannot directly play this card without risk.\n   - **Card 2 ('YX'):** Possible identities are 'Y4' or 'Y5'. The Yellow stack is at 0, and playing this card would be risky.\n   - **Card 3 ('X3'):** Possible identities are 'G3', 'W3', or 'B3'. The White and Blue stacks are past 3, but the Green stack could use a 'G3'.\n   - **Card 4 ('XX'):** Has no direct hints, wide range of possibilities - no safe play.\n   - **Card 5 ('XX'):** No direct hints, wide range of possibilities - no safe play.\n\n### Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\n\n2. **Teammate's Hand Analysis:**\n   - Player +1's 'Y4' and 'Y5' cannot be played as Yellow is at 0.\n   - Both 'W5' and 'W4' are not playable until the White stack hits 4.\n   - The 'B4' is useless as Blue is at 2 and one B4 is already discarded.\n\n### Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\n\n3. **Discard Candidates:**\n   - Discarding seems viable, as no immediate safe plays are possible with the info at hand.\n\n### Choose Optimal Action\n\nGiven the information, a reasonable action would be to discard a card to gain another info token. The least risky discard appears to be from the cards with no info yet, possibly Card 4 or Card 5.\n\n### Decision\n\n- **Chosen Action:** Discard Card 4 (since it has no specific known hints and potentially holds a variety of numbers, minimizing impact on identified critical cards).\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"No safe plays are available from my hand with current info and discard may give opportunity to regain an info token for future hints.\", \"action\": 3}\n```"

Hints suggest that the card might be: rank 3.\n  - Possible identities: 'RYGWB3'. This list represents the set of all cards that could possibly be in this position, given the hints received and the remaining cards in the deck.\n\n\nFrom your perspective, you can see the other players' hands clearly. Here's what you observe:\n\nPlayer +1's hand:\n - A card: You can see the card: 'Y5', This player knows the card might be: yellow color, This player knows the card could be one of the following: Y45.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'W5', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RGWB245.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'B4', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RGWB1245.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'B3', This player knows the card might be: rank 3, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB3.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'Y2', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n\nThere are 20 cards remaining in the deck.\nDiscard pile: R3 G4 W3 W3 R1 Y2 R5 R2 B4 R4 R1 G4 Y4 W4.\n\n\n\n\nPlease think step by step based on the current state\n\t\n# Think step by step\n\n## Evaluate Playable Cards in Hand\n\nLook at each card in your hand.\nCross-reference with the current game state to see if any card can be immediately played to complete or extend a firework stack.\nConsider hints you have received about each card (color/rank information) to determine if it might be safe to play.\nIf a card can be played without risk, prioritize playing it to score a point.\n\n## Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\n\nAnalyze the visible cards in your teammates' hands.\nIdentify if any of their cards can now be played based on the current firework stacks or previous hints.\nIf you notice a teammate holds a card that can be played but they may not realize it, think about what hints you could give them.\nUse hints to communicate critical information, such as color or rank, to help them make the right play.\nChoose the hint that maximizes the chance for a correct play while considering the limited hint tokens.\n\n## Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\n\nLook for cards in your hand that are least likely to be playable or helpful in the near future.\nConsider the remaining deck composition and cards already played/discarded to predict the value of each card.\nDiscard a card that you believe to be least useful to gain an Info token, especially if no immediate playable or hint options are available.\nEnsure that discarding this card won't permanently remove a critical card needed to complete any firework stack.\n\nNow it's your turn. You can choose from the following legal actions:\n\nThe legal actions are provided in a mapping of action identifiers to their descriptions:\n{0: '(Discard 0)', 1: '(Discard 1)', 2: '(Discard 2)', 3: '(Discard 3)', 4: '(Discard 4)', 5: '(Play 0)', 6: '(Play 1)', 7: '(Play 2)', 8: '(Play 3)', 9: '(Play 4)', 11: '(Reveal player +1 color Y)', 13: '(Reveal player +1 color W)', 14: '(Reveal player +1 color B)', 16: '(Reveal player +1 rank 2)', 17: '(Reveal player +1 rank 3)', 18: '(Reveal player +1 rank 4)', 19: '(Reveal player +1 rank 5)'}\n\n(Reveal player +N color C): Give a hint about color C to the player who is N positions ahead of you.\n(Reveal player +N rank R): Give a hint about rank R to the player who is N positions ahead.\n(Play X): Play the card in position X from your hand.\n(Discard X): Discard the card in position X from your hand.\n\nBased on the annotated state and the list of legal actions, decide on the most appropriate move to make. Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks. Good luck!\n"

However, given the current status and potential plays, let's prioritize immediate gameplay benefits.\n\n### Recommended Action\n\nGiven the analysis, playing either Card 3 or Card 5 as B3 seems the most strategic, as it extends a current firework without risk. Card 3 and Card 5 both have B3 as possible identities.\n\nLet's choose to play Card 5 for this turn to maximize current opportunity without spending info tokens.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Playing Card 5 as B3 is the safest option, extending the blue stack, utilizing potential B3 identity without risk.\", \"action\": 9}\n```"
