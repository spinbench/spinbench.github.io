        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "To excel in Hanabi, strategic coordination and careful planning are essential. Here's a structured approach based on the current game state and visible information:\n\n### 1. **Assess Priorities**\n   - **Critical Cards**: Identify 5s or missing 1s in teammates' hands. For example, if a firework is at 4 for a color, prioritize hinting the 5.\n   - **Playable Cards**: Look for the next sequential card needed in each firework (e.g., R4 if R is at R3).\n\n### 2. **Action Decision Flow**\n   - **If Info Tokens > 0**:\n     - **Give a Hint**: Target the most urgent playable card (e.g., \"Alice, your 3rd card is Red 4\" if R is at R3) or a critical 5/1.\n     - **Focus on Clarity**: Ensure the hint unambiguously identifies a playable card (e.g., hinting \"5\" if only one teammate holds a needed 5).\n   - **If Info Tokens = 0**:\n     - **Discard**: Safely discard the rightmost card (usually newest) unless it’s a unique 1/5 or critical for a stalled firework.\n   - **Play a Card**:\n     - Only if you’re confident (based on prior hints) that a card is playable. Prioritize older cards (leftmost) first.\n\n### 3. **Risk Mitigation**\n   - **Avoid Discards That Kill a Firework**: Never discard the last 1 of an unstarted color.\n   - **Protect 5s**: Never discard a 5 unless the firework is already completed.\n   - **Life Tokens**: If lives are low (≤1), avoid risky plays unless forced.\n\n### 4. **Example Scenario**\n   - **Fireworks**: R3, G1, B0, Y2, W0.\n   - **Teammate Alice’s Hand**: R4 (playable!), G2, B1, Y3 (playable for Y2→Y3), W1.\n   - **Teammate Bob’s Hand**: G1 (duplicate, discardable), R5 (needs R4 first), Y4 (future play).\n   - **Action**: Hint \"Red\" to Alice to highlight R4 (playable now) or \"3\" to point to Y3. Alternatively, discard Bob’s duplicate G1 to regain an info token.\n\n### 5. **Endgame Preparation**\n   - If the deck is nearly empty, prioritize playing over discarding/hinting.\n   - Ensure all critical cards (especially 5s) are positioned to be played in final turns.\n\n### Final Decision:\n**Give Alice a \"Red\" hint** to direct her to play R4 (advancing the red firework to R4) while preserving info tokens for future coordination. This maximizes progress with minimal risk."

Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks.

You can choose from the following legal actions:\n\nThe legal actions are provided in a mapping of action identifiers to their descriptions:\n{0: '(Discard 0)', 1: '(Discard 1)', 2: '(Discard 2)', 3: '(Discard 3)', 4: '(Discard 4)', 5: '(Play 0)', 6: '(Play 1)', 7: '(Play 2)', 8: '(Play 3)', 9: '(Play 4)', 11: '(Reveal player +1 color Y)', 12: '(Reveal player +1 color G)', 13: '(Reveal player +1 color W)', 15: '(Reveal player +1 rank 1)', 16: '(Reveal player +1 rank 2)', 17: '(Reveal player +1 rank 3)', 18: '(Reveal player +1 rank 4)'}\n\n(Reveal player +N color C): Give a hint about color C to the player who is N positions ahead of you.\n(Reveal player +N rank R): Give a hint about rank R to the player who is N positions ahead.\n(Play X): Play the card in position X from your hand.\n(Discard X): Discard the card in position X from your hand.\n\nBased on the annotated state and the list of legal actions, decide on the most appropriate move to make. Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks. Good luck!\n"

        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "In Hanabi, effective strategy revolves around maximizing information efficiency and minimizing risks. Here's a structured approach to optimize your turn:\n\n### 1. **Assess Firework Progress**  \n   - Identify the next critical card(s) needed for each color.  \n     - Example: If Red is at 3, prioritize playing/discarding Red 4s or hinting them in others’ hands.  \n   - Check for missing low numbers (e.g., if Green 1 is discarded, Green 2+ cannot be played).  \n\n### 2. **Evaluate Teammates’ Hands**  \n   - Look for **playable cards** (next in sequence for a color) or **critical saves** (e.g., 5s, last copies of a number).  \n   - If a teammate holds a playable card (e.g., Blue 2 when Blue is at 1), consider hinting its color/number to prompt a play.  \n   - If a teammate has a 5 or an irreplaceable card (e.g., the last Yellow 2), prioritize hinting to prevent discards.  \n\n### 3. **Action Prioritization**  \n   - **Play a Card** if:  \n     - You’ve received a direct hint (e.g., “This is Red” + Red firework is at 2 → play as Red 3).  \n     - Logic suggests a card is safe (e.g., oldest unclued card when all critical cards are accounted for).  \n   - **Give a Hint** if:  \n     - Info tokens are available, and a critical card (e.g., a 5 or next-needed number) is in a teammate’s hand.  \n     - A hint can trigger a chain of plays (e.g., hinting a 3 to set up a 4 play after the 3 is placed).  \n   - **Discard** if:  \n     - Info tokens are depleted, and your oldest unclued card is likely useless (e.g., duplicate 1s, a color already maxed).  \n\n### 4. **Risk Management**  \n   - Avoid gambling with life tokens if the team has ≤1 life remaining.  \n   - Use **conventions** (e.g., “chop” = discard oldest unclued card, “finesse” = hint to trigger a play assuming another player has the prerequisite card).  \n\n### 5. **Endgame Considerations**  \n   - When the deck is nearly empty, focus on plays over hints (no need to conserve info tokens).  \n   - Ensure all critical cards are hinted before the final turns.  \n\n### Example Turn Decision Flow:  \n- **Fireworks**: Red 2, Blue 1, others at 0.  \n- **Teammate’s Hand**: Holds Blue 2 and Red 3.  \n- **Action**: Hint “Blue” to teammate to play Blue 2, advancing the firework and preserving Blue 3/4/5 for future plays.  \n\nBy systematically prioritizing plays, protecting critical cards, and communicating efficiently, your team can maximize the score while minimizing risks. 🎆"
