Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

Here's what you observe:\n\nPlayer +1's hand:\n - A card: You can see the card: 'Y4', This player knows the card might be: yellow color, This player knows the card could be one of the following: Y1345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'Y1', This player knows the card might be: yellow color, This player knows the card could be one of the following: Y12345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'Y2', This player knows the card might be: yellow color, This player knows the card could be one of the following: Y12345.\n\nPlayer +2's hand:\n - A card: You can see the card: 'B5', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: GWB1245.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'G2', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: YGWB1245.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'B4', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n\nPlayer +3's hand:\n - A card: You can see the card: 'R2', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'W1', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'W2', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n\nPlayer +4's hand:\n - A card: You can see the card: 'B1', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'B4', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'R5', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'R1', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n\nThere are 0 cards remaining in the deck.\nDiscard pile: R1 Y5 W3 G3 G4 R3 Y4 R4 B2 W4 G1 G1 W1 W3 G5 R4 Y1 W4 G4 W5.\n\n\n\n\nPlease think step by step based on the current state\n\t\n# Think step by step\n\n## Evaluate Playable Cards in Hand\n\nLook at each card in your hand.\nCross-reference with the current game state to see if any card can be immediately played to complete or extend a firework stack.\nConsider hints you have received about each card (color/rank information) to determine if it might be safe to play.\nIf a card can be played without risk, prioritize playing it to score a point.\n\n## Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\n\nAnalyze the visible cards in your teammates' hands.\nIdentify if any of their cards can now be played based on the current firework stacks or previous hints.\nIf you notice a teammate holds a card that can be played but they may not realize it, think about what hints you could give them.\nUse hints to communicate critical information, such as color or rank, to help them make the right play.\nChoose the hint that maximizes the chance for a correct play while considering the limited hint tokens.\n\n## Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\n\nLook for cards in your hand that are least likely to be playable or helpful in the near future.\nConsider the remaining deck composition and cards already played/discarded to predict the value of each card.\nDiscard a card that you believe to be least useful to gain an Info token, especially if no immediate playable or hint options are available.\nEnsure that discarding this card won't permanently remove a critical card needed to complete any firework stack.\n\nNow it's your turn. You can choose from the following legal actions:\n\nThe legal actions are provided in a mapping of action identifiers to their descriptions:\n{0: '(Discard 0)', 1: '(Discard 1)', 2: '(Discard 2)', 3: '(Discard 3)', 4: '(Play 0)', 5: '(Play 1)', 6: '(Play 2)', 7: '(Play 3)', 9: '(Reveal player +1 color Y)', 15: '(Reveal player +2 color G)', 17: '(Reveal player +2 color B)', 18: '(Reveal player +3 color R)', 21: '(Reveal player +3 color W)', 23: '(Reveal player +4 color R)', 27: '(Reveal player +4 color B)', 28: '(Reveal player +1 rank 1)', 29: '(Reveal player +1 rank 2)', 31: '(Reveal player +1 rank 4)', 34: '(Reveal player +2 rank 2)', 36: '(Reveal player +2 rank 4)', 37: '(Reveal player +2 rank 5)', 38: '(Reveal player +3 rank 1)', 39: '(Reveal player +3 rank 2)', 43: '(Reveal player +4 rank 1)', 46: '(Reveal player +4 rank 4)', 47: '(Reveal player +4 rank 5)'}\n\n(Reveal player +N color C): Give a hint about color C to the player who is N positions ahead of you.\n(Reveal player +N rank R): Give a hint about rank R to the player who is N positions ahead.\n(Play X): Play the card in position X from your hand.\n(Discard X): Discard the card in position X from your hand.\n\nBased on the annotated state and the list of legal actions, decide on the most appropriate move to make. Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks. Good luck!\n"

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.6 or higher recommended).\n2. Copy the entire code into a file named `hanabi_game.py`.\n3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `hanabi_game.py`.\n4. Run the script using the command:\n   ```\n   python hanabi_game.py\n   ```\n5. The game will simulate turns between the players \"Alice,\" \"Bob,\" and \"Charlie,\" printing out each action taken and the final score at the end.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- The `Player` class contains a basic decision-making method, `decide_action`, which uses simple heuristics. In a more advanced implementation, this method could incorporate more sophisticated strategies based on the game's state and the players' knowledge.\n- The `GameState` class manages interactions between players and the overall game progression, including handling hints, plays, and discards.\n- This simplified version does not cover all edge cases and advanced rules of Hanabi but serves as a foundational example that can be expanded for more comprehensive gameplay and AI strategies."

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"
