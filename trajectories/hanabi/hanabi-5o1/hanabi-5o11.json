Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks.

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks.

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

        "content": "Below is an overview of key strategic considerations and best practices for Hanabi, based on commonly used approaches and the rules you’ve outlined. These ideas center on maximizing team coordination, efficient use of information tokens, and avoiding unnecessary risks.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Information Management\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Use Info Tokens Wisely: \n  – Every clue (hint) should be meaningful. Avoid giving information that does not lead to an immediate or near-future action. Efficiency of each hint is crucial because Info tokens are limited.  \n  – Prioritize clues that guide teammates to safely play (or discard) at least one card soon after receiving the hint.  \n• Clarify “Useless” vs. “Useful” Cards:\n  – If you can point out that a card is unplayable (e.g., a duplicate of a number already played or obviously out of sequence), you may help your teammate know it can be safely discarded.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Play vs. Discard Decision\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Safe-Play Cues:\n  – In many Hanabi conventions, when a teammate gives a clue that strongly indicates a specific card is playable right away, the hinted player should proceed to play that card.  \n  – Some groups use “prompt” or “finesse” strategies, where a color or number clue implies the leftmost or rightmost of the indicated cards is the immediate playable card.  \n• When to Discard:\n  – If no safe play is apparent, discarding can be valuable to recycle Info tokens (especially if you suspect a card is a duplicate or otherwise no longer needed).  \n  – Remember that discarding blindly can risk throwing away a crucial card (like a unique 5 or the only copy of a needed 4 for a color), so weigh that risk carefully unless you’re confident in the card’s unimportance.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Coordinating Clues for Sequences\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Early-Game Priority: 1s and 2s\n  – Getting the 1s into play as soon as possible is critical since they're required to start each pile. Hints that identify 1s can be highly efficient.  \n  – Once a color’s “1” is played, clueing a “2” of that same color becomes a high-value move to keep the sequence going.  \n• Tracking Discarded Cards:\n  – Keep mental track of how many copies of each number have been discarded. If all copies of a particular digit/color are gone, that color/number can no longer be completed—this influences which cards to discard and which to preserve in hand.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Avoiding Costly Mistakes\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Treat Life Tokens As Valuable Resources:\n  – A wrong play costs one Life token. Reserve guesswork for when you have enough Life tokens to afford an error or when playing correct cards is uncertain but critical.  \n• Directed Finesses:\n  – A strong clue sometimes indicates the person receiving the clue holds a missing link in the sequence. In advanced strategies, you can “finesse” neighbors to play a card they haven’t been explicitly told is playable but often can deduce from context.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Communication Conventions (If Allowed)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Positional Clues:\n  – Groups often adopt a convention that a clue referencing multiple cards in hand might mean “the leftmost is the next to play.” This is not an official rule but a common house convention.  \n• “Known Useless” Clues:\n  – If you clue a color or number that obviously doesn’t match the needed sequence, teammates often interpret it as “you can safely discard” or “I need you to know something about the rest of your cards.”  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n6) Endgame Considerations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• Tight Resource Management:\n  – As you approach the end of the deck, each clue and discard matter more. Try to preserve enough Info tokens so you can clue critical plays in the final rounds.  \n• Watch the Final Turn:\n  – After the deck is empty, each player gets exactly one more turn. Plan out how you’ll chain final clues and plays to maximize the completed fireworks.  \n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBy focusing on efficient clue-giving, carefully choosing when to play versus discard, and maintaining awareness of what cards have been discarded or played, you and your fellow players can greatly increase the odds of completing all 25 cards in a perfect game. The art of Hanabi lies in subtle, cooperative communication—every hint should lead teammates to act confidently, and every discard or play should be informed by both visible cards and the team’s established conventions.\n\nEnjoy your game, and best of luck lighting up all five fireworks!"

        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

Since you’ve laid out the rules and the overall game structure, the next step would be to look at a specific game state and decide how best to use our limited options—giving hints, discarding, or playing a card—to progress the fireworks as efficiently as possible.\n\nIf you’d like to walk through a turn-by-turn strategy, here’s what I suggest doing next:\n\n1. Provide Current Game Details:\n   • Life tokens (remaining).  \n   • Info tokens (available).  \n   • Fireworks progress for each color (for example, Red is at 1, Yellow is at 0, etc.).  \n   • Discard pile contents (if any).  \n   • The visible hands of all other players (colors and numbers that I can see).  \n\n2. Discuss Possible Moves:\n   • Hint: Which hints might be most valuable? For example, pointing out a critical “1” card to ensure it’s not unknowingly discarded, or identifying which card is playable next in the sequence.  \n   • Discard: Discarding a likely duplicate or a card that is no longer needed (for instance, a second or third copy of a number you’ve already placed). This helps regain info tokens.  \n   • Play: If you have strong evidence a card in your own hand is playable next in the sequence—either via prior hints or deduction—attempting to play it advances progress.\n\n3. Evaluate Risk:\n   • Balancing the use of life tokens (don’t risk a blind play that could cost a life if you’re uncertain).  \n   • Ensuring you have enough info tokens to give strategic hints.\n\nOnce we have the current board situation, we can discuss which moves are most logical. Feel free to provide the details, and we’ll plan our next action!"

You can choose from the following legal actions:\n\nThe legal actions are provided in a mapping of action identifiers to their descriptions:\n{0: '(Discard 0)', 1: '(Discard 1)', 2: '(Discard 2)', 3: '(Discard 3)', 4: '(Play 0)', 5: '(Play 1)', 6: '(Play 2)', 7: '(Play 3)'}\n\n(Reveal player +N color C): Give a hint about color C to the player who is N positions ahead of you.\n(Reveal player +N rank R): Give a hint about rank R to the player who is N positions ahead.\n(Play X): Play the card in position X from your hand.\n(Discard X): Discard the card in position X from your hand.\n\nBased on the annotated state and the list of legal actions, decide on the most appropriate move to make. Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks.
