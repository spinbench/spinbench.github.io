        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

As a master of the game, I know that our goal is to complete the fireworks by playing the cards in sequence from 1 to 5 for each color while carefully managing our life tokens and information tokens. Remember:\n\n• On your turn, you can either give a hint to a teammate (only specifying a color or a number and only revealing cards that match that hint), play one of your own cards (risking a life token if it doesn't correctly add to a firework), or discard one of your cards (to recover an info token and potentially recycle useful cards).\n\n• Our game state is tracked by:\n – Life Tokens: Reduced when a wrong card is played.\n – Info Tokens: Used up when giving hints and recovered on a successful discard.\n – Fireworks: Each color builds up sequentially (e.g., Red from 1 up, etc.).\n – Discard Pile: Shows cards that are no longer in play.\n\n• We must be careful not to give hints that overstep the rules of allowed clues, and we need to communicate indirectly to help each other play the right cards despite not being able to see our own hands.\n\nNow, let’s discuss our current situation or any questions you might have. Do you have a specific game state or a move you’d like to analyze? How shall we proceed with our cooperative strategy?"

Here's what you observe:\n\nPlayer +1's hand:\n - A card: You can see the card: 'R4', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'Y2', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'Y3', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'W3', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'W1', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n\nThere are 40 cards remaining in the deck.\nThe discard pile is currently empty.\n\n\n\n\nPlease think step by step based on the current state\n\t\n# Think step by step\n\n## Evaluate Playable Cards in Hand\n\nLook at each card in your hand.\nCross-reference with the current game state to see if any card can be immediately played to complete or extend a firework stack.\nConsider hints you have received about each card (color/rank information) to determine if it might be safe to play.\nIf a card can be played without risk, prioritize playing it to score a point.\n\n## Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\n\nAnalyze the visible cards in your teammates' hands.\nIdentify if any of their cards can now be played based on the current firework stacks or previous hints.\nIf you notice a teammate holds a card that can be played but they may not realize it, think about what hints you could give them.\nUse hints to communicate critical information, such as color or rank, to help them make the right play.\nChoose the hint that maximizes the chance for a correct play while considering the limited hint tokens.\n\n## Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\n\nLook for cards in your hand that are least likely to be playable or helpful in the near future.\nConsider the remaining deck composition and cards already played/discarded to predict the value of each card.\nDiscard a card that you believe to be least useful to gain an Info token, especially if no immediate playable or hint options are available.\nEnsure that discarding this card won't permanently remove a critical card needed to complete any firework stack.\n\nNow it's your turn. You can choose from the following legal actions:\n\nThe legal actions are provided in a mapping of action identifiers to their descriptions:\n{5: '(Play 0)', 6: '(Play 1)', 7: '(Play 2)', 8: '(Play 3)', 9: '(Play 4)', 10: '(Reveal player +1 color R)', 11: '(Reveal player +1 color Y)', 13: '(Reveal player +1 color W)', 15: '(Reveal player +1 rank 1)', 16: '(Reveal player +1 rank 2)', 17: '(Reveal player +1 rank 3)', 18: '(Reveal player +1 rank 4)'}\n\n(Reveal player +N color C): Give a hint about color C to the player who is N positions ahead of you.\n(Reveal player +N rank R): Give a hint about rank R to the player who is N positions ahead.\n(Play X): Play the card in position X from your hand.\n(Discard X): Discard the card in position X from your hand.\n\nBased on the annotated state and the list of legal actions, decide on the most appropriate move to make. Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks. Good luck!\n"

        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "Below is an example of how I, as a Hanabi master, think through my turn and coordinate with my teammates during play. Imagine we’re in a game with the following state:\n\n • Life Tokens: 3 remaining  \n • Info Tokens: 8 available  \n • Fireworks: Red is at 1 (so we need to play a red 2 next), Yellow, Green, White, and Blue haven’t been started yet  \n • Discards: (various noncritical cards so far)\n\nEven though I can’t see my own cards, I can see all the cards in my teammates' hands. Here’s how I approach my turn:\n\n1. Analyze the Fireworks and Identify Needs:\n – For the red firework: The next required card is a red 2.\n – For the other colors: I know the sequence must begin with card 1.\n – I check my teammates’ hands to see if any card is immediately playable based on the current progress.\n\n2. Look at Teammate Hands for Playable Cards:\n – Suppose I see that one teammate holds a red card that might be a 2 (though they don’t know its number because they can’t see their own hand).  \n – Alternatively, another teammate might have a card that could be a 1 in blue (if blue hasn’t been started yet) but hasn’t been hinted about.\n\n3. Deciding on an Action:\n • Hint (Information):  \n  – If I spot a card that is clearly playable based on what’s visible (like that potential red 2), I may give a hint about its color or number.  \n  – For example, if a teammate’s card is the only red card in their hand, and I know that red 2 is needed, I would say, “Your card(s) that are red…” which lets them know that if they have been given no other hint, this card is likely playable.  \n  – I always aim to give hints which maximize information while minimizing ambiguity.\n   \n • Play:  \n  – If I have received hints on my own cards in previous turns and I’m confident that one of my cards is immediately playable (like a 1 in a color with no cards played yet, or a 2 that follows on a 1 already on the board), I would play that card.\n  – It’s vital not to rush playing if there’s any uncertainty. A misplayed card costs a life token, which is a precious resource.\n \n • Discard:  \n  – If no teammate’s hand currently contains a clearly identifiable playable card or if I urgently need to recycle an information token, then discarding a card can be beneficial.\n  – The choice is to discard a card that I believe isn’t going to be needed or is a duplicate of one that can be played later (always keeping in mind the limitations of the deck).\n\n4. Example Turn Decision:\n – Let’s assume I observe my teammate, Alex, has two cards, and their leftmost card is the only unhinted red card on their hand. Given that the red firework is at 1, this card should be a red 2 to continue the sequence.\n – I decide to give a hint about “Red” to Alex. This informs them that the red card in question is likely playable.\n – Once Alex receives the hint, they will know that if their card is red, and red 2 is the next necessary play (because red 1 is on the board), they should feel confident about playing it.\n\n5. Coordination and Future Planning:\n – Future hints can focus on identifying safe 1s in further colors or clarifying number information.\n – Always preserving a good number of info tokens is strategic. Giving a hint when you have plenty of info tokens helps ensure that later in the game, if tokens run low, you can make riskier decisions with more guidance.\n\nBy following these guidelines—carefully reading the game state, judging which cards are actually “in play” for needed sequences, and communicating precise hints—I help our team advance the fireworks systematically. This overall cooperative play, where each hint or decision is made with the shared goal in mind, is at the heart of mastering Hanabi.\n\nIn summary, my masterful approach is to:\n • Prioritize playing the obvious next cards in each sequence.\n • Use hints to signal those intended plays clearly.\n • Discard only when it helps recover the information tokens we need.\n\nThis coordinated and analytical approach keeps our lives tokens safe and pushes our score closer to the perfect 25."
