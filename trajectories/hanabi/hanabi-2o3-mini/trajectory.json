To recover an info token so we can later let them know to play that card, we must discard one of our own cards. Among our cards, Card 2 (position 1) is marked as red and its possibilities are R1, R3, R4, and R5. Since the red firework is at 1 and we need red2 next, this card will not be playable now. Hence, discarding it is the safest choice to regain a hint token for our partner.",

Meanwhile, Cards 1\u20133 (with possibilities 'YGB345' and 'RYGWB345') have very low probabilities (roughly 11%\u201313%) of matching the next needed firework (only a blue 3 from Card 1 or a white/blue 3 from Cards 2\u20133 would work). Therefore, it is wiser to safely discard one of these less likely-to-be-playable cards to recover an info token. In this case, discarding Card 1 (index 0) is a good candidate, as its chance to be immediately playable is marginally lower. This gives us an info token on our next turn so that we can provide a critical hint to our partner regarding one of their immediately playable cards (for instance, indicating that the card showing Green 2 is needed).",

The three completely unknown cards (cards 1, 2, and 5) are less likely to be immediately playable because their possibilities are 3, 4, or 5 (and for white and blue only a 3 would be playable, while red, yellow and green require a 2). To minimize risk of discarding an immediately necessary card, I choose to discard one of these unknown cards. I select card position 0 as it is unknown and its set (345) does not include any rank 2, making it unlikely to be immediately useful.
