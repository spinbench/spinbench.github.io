        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

You can choose from the following legal actions:\n\nThe legal actions are provided in a mapping of action identifiers to their descriptions:\n{4: '(Play 0)', 5: '(Play 1)', 6: '(Play 2)', 7: '(Play 3)', 8: '(Reveal player +1 color R)', 10: '(Reveal player +1 color G)', 11: '(Reveal player +1 color W)', 12: '(Reveal player +1 color B)', 13: '(Reveal player +2 color R)', 14: '(Reveal player +2 color Y)', 17: '(Reveal player +2 color B)', 19: '(Reveal player +3 color Y)', 21: '(Reveal player +3 color W)', 22: '(Reveal player +3 color B)', 25: '(Reveal player +4 color G)', 26: '(Reveal player +4 color W)', 27: '(Reveal player +4 color B)', 28: '(Reveal player +1 rank 1)', 29: '(Reveal player +1 rank 2)', 30: '(Reveal player +1 rank 3)', 33: '(Reveal player +2 rank 1)', 34: '(Reveal player +2 rank 2)', 36: '(Reveal player +2 rank 4)', 38: '(Reveal player +3 rank 1)', 39: '(Reveal player +3 rank 2)', 42: '(Reveal player +3 rank 5)', 44: '(Reveal player +4 rank 2)', 45: '(Reveal player +4 rank 3)', 46: '(Reveal player +4 rank 4)', 47: '(Reveal player +4 rank 5)'}\n\n(Reveal player +N color C): Give a hint about color C to the player who is N positions ahead of you.\n(Reveal player +N rank R): Give a hint about rank R to the player who is N positions ahead.\n(Play X): Play the card in position X from your hand.\n(Discard X): Discard the card in position X from your hand.\n\nBased on the annotated state and the list of legal actions, decide on the most appropriate move to make. Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks. Good luck!\n"

Therefore, playing any of them is risky at this point.\n\n2. **Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities**:\n   - **Player +1**: Has a 'G1' which can be played immediately. This is crucial for starting the green firework stack.\n   - **Player +2**: Has 'R1' and 'Y1', both of which are playable since all stacks are at 0.\n   - **Player +3**: Has 'B1' and 'W1', both of which are also playable. Highlighting the '1's here could help them to make the right play.\n   - **Player +4**: No immediately playable '1' cards.\n\n3. **Assess Options**:\n   - We should focus on playing the '1' cards to get as many stacks started as possible. 'G1' in Player +1’s hand is the first immediate opportunity to start the green stack.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the most efficient move is to use a hint to let Player +1 know about their 'G1' card. This helps them understand their card is playable. We should reveal the color 'G' as it isolates the card they need to play.\n\nHere’s our action choice:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Revealing Player +1's G1 so they can start the green stack.\", \"action\": 10}\n```"

Assisting them with a color clue could prompt them to play it immediately.\n   - Player +3 has a `W1`, which is also playable, and they know it is Rank 1. They should be able to play it without needing further hints.\n   - Player +4 has no immediate cards that are ready to be played, so focusing on the other players is a better strategy for now.\n   \n3. **Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens:**\n   - Discarding could regain us an info token, which is valuable in our current info-limited situation.

        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

        "content": "In this Hanabi game, we'll work together strategically to reach the highest score possible. Here’s how we’ll approach it:\n\n1. **Prioritize Playing Cards:** If you have enough information to confidently play a card, make that your priority. Early on, focus on playing the '1' cards of each color to build the foundation for the fireworks.\n\n2. **Efficient Use of Hints:** Give hints that maximize future actions. When giving a hint, try to target multiple cards in a player's hand and set up plays for the next few turns. Prioritize hinting about playable cards, especially if they are '1' cards or cards needed in sequence.\n\n3. **Smart Discarding:** Discard cards that are least likely to be useful, such as duplicates or higher-numbered cards (especially if lower-numbered cards have not been played yet). Discarding can help regain info tokens for future hints.\n\n4. **Managing Tokens:** Keep an eye on the info tokens. Avoid running out by balancing discarding and giving hints. Life tokens should be preserved by avoiding risky plays unless you are running out of moves.\n\n5. **Communication and Planning:** Use hints not only to convey immediate actions but also to plan future turns. Remember the information you’ve received to minimize errors and maximize card plays.\n\nNow, let's simulate a round so we can make the best decision on your turn. Please provide the current game state (number of life tokens, info tokens, firework progress, discards, and the visible cards of other players), and I'll advise on the optimal next move."

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

This is efficient given the limited information tokens.\n   - Additionally, hinting about rank '1' could also make Player +1 aware of their 'B1' being play-ready.\n\n### Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\n4. **Current Strategy:**\n   - Given that we still have 3 info tokens, prioritizing hints to enable immediate plays is preferable over discarding for tokens right now.\n\n### Conclusion\nI recommend providing a hint to Player +1 about their rank '1' to enable them to play the 'B1', which directly helps progress the blue fireworks.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Providing a hint to Player +1 about their rank '1' helps them play their B1 card, which advances the blue stack immediately with minimal risk and efficiently uses the available info tokens.\",\n  \"action\": 28\n}\n```"

Given the firework stacks are at R1, Y1, G1, W1, B1, this card is highly likely to be playable if it belongs to any stack that progresses beyond 1.\n\n2. **Card 3**: Your card has a hint indicating it is a rank 1. However, since all stacks already have 1, it cannot be played immediately.\n\n## Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\n1. Player +1 has a **W2**, which can be played to advance the white stack to W2. Revealing the rank or color of this card would allow them to play it.\n\n2. Player +3 has a **G2**, which can be played to advance the green stack to G2. Given the limited hints, focusing on Player +1’s W2 seems more strategic due to the additional card information they already have.\n\n## Assess Discard Options\nGiven the critical nature of possibly advancing the white stack and our limited info tokens, discarding may not be the best first action. Instead, using a hint to optimize play seems more strategic.\n\n## Recommended Action\n**Action**: Reveal player +1 the white color to help them play their W2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Revealing the white color to Player +1 will allow them to safely play their W2, advancing the white firework stack to 2.\",\n  \"action\": 11\n}\n```"

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

No clear option to play safely without risk.\n\n2. **Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities:**\n   - Currently, Player +2 holds a `R1`, which is directly playable since the red stack is at 1, and we need to play `R2` next.\n   - Player +3's `G1` is also immediately playable since the green stack is at 0.\n\n3. **Assess Info Token Usage:**\n   - Giving Player +2 a hint about the rank `1` will allow them to immediately play the `R1`.\n   - We have 6 info tokens available, so using one is a solid option to facilitate playing a card.\n\n4. **Optimal Decision:**\n   - The best move is to use an info token to reveal rank `1` to Player +2, informing them that they can play their `R1`, which is immediately playable given the current state of the fireworks.\n\nWith this in mind, here is the chosen action:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Reveal rank 1 to Player +2, enabling them to play the red 1 card, which is currently needed.\", \"action\": 33}\n```"

There are no visible other rank 1s in player hands for Y, G, or B, so it's a good candidate for playing without risking a penalty.\n\n- **Card 4**: You know this is a White 1, which is also immediately playable since the White stack is at 0. However, since Card 2 is a general rank 1 (with more possibilities including Y, G, B), playing Card 2 should take precedence as it covers more bases.\n\n### Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\n\n- **Player +3** has a Green 1, which is also playable. However, the player seems aware it's a green card, as they have a hint indicating color. No immediate hint action seems optimal, since the most critical play for them is already known.\n\n### Assess Discard Options\n\n- There is no pressing need to discard right now, as there are cards that can be safely played.\n\n### Action Choice\n\nGiven the analysis, playing your Card 2, known to be a rank 1, is a safe and effective move. You have a probability to continue any initial stack (Y, G, W, B), maximizing the play option without needing more information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Card 2 in my hand is confirmed as rank 1, and any rank 1 is playable given the current state of firework stacks.

Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters.

The cards marked as white could potentially be W2, but there is already a W2 in Player +1's hand, so your chances of having a playable white card are not clear without further information.\n\n2. **Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities**:\n   - Player +3's G1 is the only immediate playable card and crucial to progress the green firework stack, which is currently at G1.\n   - Notably, Player +3 is already aware that the card is a G1.\n   - Other potential plays include Player +4's R2 or Y2 or Player +1's W2, but any reveal must be considered against available info tokens.\n\n3. **Assess Discard Options**:\n   - Discarding should be a last resort due to the critical nature of cards in the game and potential loss of scoring opportunities. However, gaining an information token is important to offer more hints in future turns.\n\nConsidering the current game state, I've identified that revealing Player +4's rank 2, which includes R2 and Y2, can open up direct plays in both the red and yellow stacks:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Revealing the rank 2 to Player +4 enables them to play either the R2 or Y2, furthering the progress of red or yellow fireworks and maintaining momentum.\",\n  \"action\": 44\n}\n```\n\nRevealing rank 2 to Player +4 strengthens their options and prompts actions without immediately risking a life token or the need to discard."

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

However, they already know it might be a rank 1 card. It’s good to reconfirm by revealing 'R' color to player +1 for the Red 1 card.\n- **Player +2** has a Green 1 (G1). The Green stack is at 0, so this card can be played right away. They have been given a hint that the card might be green, which is advantageous.\n- **Player +3** has a Yellow 1 (Y1), and the Yellow stack is at 0. They are aware of its rank and can play it.\n- **Player +4** has a White 1 (W1), and the White stack is at 0. They have no clues about this card, which could be useful.\n\nGiven these observations, we can maximize our potential plays by ensuring critical information is communicated.\n\n## Assess Discard Options\n- Since there are 5 info tokens available, there’s no immediate need to discard to gain an info token.\n\n## Suggested Action\nThe best move would be to give a color clue to Player +4 about their White 1 card. This gives them a chance to play the card immediately, progressing the sequence and taking advantage of an otherwise unnoticed opportunity. \n\nTherefore, I'll choose to reveal the 'White' color to Player +4, enabling them to know about their playable White 1 card.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Player +4 has a White 1, which can be played.

While this player has a hint for rank 1, it doesn't explicitly direct them to play it. Since a direct action may help progress the game, highlighting the blue color could be useful.\n   \n2. **Player +2** has potentially playable cards:\n   - **G1** is playable. The current stack for green is at 0. However, Player +2 already knows the color of this card is green, so no need to hint.\n   \n3. **Player +3** has playable cards:\n   - **G1** and **R1** can be played. Highlighting rank 1 could help Player +3 to play **R1** to enhance the red stack.\n   \n4. **Player +4's** hand doesn't currently have cards that are directly playable.\n\n### Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\nDiscarding at this point, especially without knowing what's in your hand, poses a risk as it might discard a playable card crucial for firework completion.\n\n### Decide on the Best Action\nGiven that Player +3 has multiple options, providing them with a hint about rank 1 aligns multiple cards available for play, optimizing the chance of chain successful plays.\n\nThus, an effective strategy is to reveal rank 1 to Player +3, as it could lead them to immediately place a card to progress a firework stack.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Reveal to Player +3 the rank 1 to allow them to play R1 or G1 based on current firework status, maximizing immediate game progress.\",\"action\": 38}\n```"

You can choose from the following legal actions:\n\nThe legal actions are provided in a mapping of action identifiers to their descriptions:\n{0: '(Discard 0)', 1: '(Discard 1)', 2: '(Discard 2)', 3: '(Discard 3)', 4: '(Play 0)', 5: '(Play 1)', 6: '(Play 2)', 7: '(Play 3)'}\n\n(Reveal player +N color C): Give a hint about color C to the player who is N positions ahead of you.\n(Reveal player +N rank R): Give a hint about rank R to the player who is N positions ahead.\n(Play X): Play the card in position X from your hand.\n(Discard X): Discard the card in position X from your hand.\n\nBased on the annotated state and the list of legal actions, decide on the most appropriate move to make. Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks. Good luck!\n"

        "content": "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to determine the best move given the current game state:\n\n## Evaluate Playable Cards in Hand\n\nYour hand:\n- Card 3 has a known rank 3, but without color information, it's risky to play. We need more info on other cards or focus on teammates.\n- Other cards have no specific information.\n\n## Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\n\n**Player +2's hand:**\n- Card: 'G1' – This card can be played immediately to advance the green firework stack.\n\n## Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\n\nWith 0 info tokens available, it's critical to decide whether to discard to gain tokens or play cards.\n\nGiven the situation:\n- We have 1 life token and crucial plays are possible for our teammates.\n- Playing Player +2's 'G1' will advance the stack without risk since they already have partial information about the card.\n  \n## Choose Action\n\nThe priority is to signal Player +2 to play their 'G1'. However, as we have no info tokens, we cannot give hints. Thus, we should discard a card to regain one token and give the critical hint next turn.\n\nLet's discard a card least likely to hurt our progress:\n\n- Card 2 or 4 in your hand, with no hints, less probability of being a critical early card given the progress.\n\nLet's proceed with discarding card 1 to gain an info token:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"We have no info tokens available and discarding a card will gain one. Card 1 has no known information and is least likely to be crucial.\",\n  \"action\": 0\n}\n```\nThis action regains an info token, preparing us for strategic hinting in the following turn."
