Card1 might be a 2 needed for red/yellow/green/white if it turns out that way. Meanwhile, cards 3 and 4 are completely unconstrained. Discarding one of these is less risky.

The other three cards carry no information and are more ambiguous. By discarding one of these unknown cards, we restore an info token and get more flexibility on future turns. Discarding card position 1 (our second card) seems optimal since it has no hint data at all, preserving card 0 that might be playable if itâ€™s yellow 3. Therefore, the best action is to discard our card in position 1.', 'action': 1}</p>

<p>{'reason': "We are currently out of info tokens and need one to help guide our teammates (who hold several cards needed to continue the fireworks). In our own hand, Card 0 (with known info indicating a rank 1) could be the blue 1 that is critical, so we want to keep it despite its uncertainty. Card 2 and Card 3 are completely ambiguous and could be needed later for a red 2, green 2, etc. However, Card 1 (whose possibilities are 'RYGB1345' and that excludes a 2) cannot be a red 2 or green 2 â€“ the only needed values it could match are a yellow 3 or a blue 1, both of which are available in othersâ€™ hands. This makes Card 1 the least promising candidate for an immediate play. Discarding it will grant us an info token, which in turn will let us give a critical hint to one of our teammates who currently holds several cards that are exactly the next cards for their fireworks (B1, Y3, or W3). Thus, discarding Card 1 is the optimal action under the situation.", 'action': 1}</p>

In contrast, cards 2 and 4 carry no hints and have a very low probability (about 15%) of matching the next needed cards (only playable if, for example, card2 is yellow 3, white 3, or blue 1). Discarding one of these unknown cards is the safest option because it minimizes the risk of blowing a life token while also restoring an info token for future helpful hints.

<h3>Player Response:</h3>
<p>{'reason': "We have no info tokens to give a hint, so our only options are playing a card or discarding one to gain an info token. Looking at our hand, the two cards with known rank information (cards in positions 1 and 2, both showing 'X3') are interesting. Given the discards, each can only be R3, Y3, or W3. On the board the yellow firework is at 2 (so Y3 is playable) and the white firework is at 2 (so W3 is playable). Only if the card is R3 would it be unplayable (since red is at 1 and needs R2 next). Thus there is roughly a 2/3 chance that either card is immediately playable. Since playing a card is crucial for advancing our scoreâ€”and we already see other players with playable cardsâ€”it is a good risk. I therefore decide to play the card in position 1 (i.e. our second card), which is action 5 (Play 1).", 'action': 5}</p>

<h3>Player Response:</h3>
<p>{'reason': 'We have no info tokens, so we cannot give hints to help teammates even though several of them hold clearly playable cards. My own hand is mostly ambiguous, and while card 0 has a yellow hint (and might be playable if it is Y4 which is the yellow card we need), cards 2, 3, and 1 are completely uninformative. In order to recover an info token safely, I should discard a card that is unlikely to be the immediately needed card. Between card 1 (position 0) and cards 2 (position 1), 3 (position 2), and 4 (position 3), card 1 has a chance to be Y4 (the yellow card needed), so I want to keep it. The two cards with positions 1 and 2 are identical in their uncertainty (possibilities: R, G, W, B and any rank), and discarding one of them is less risky. Thus, discarding card in position 1 (action id 1) recovers an info token and sets us up to hint a teammate (for example, telling Player +4 that their card R3 is playable) on a subsequent turn.', 'action': 1}</p>
