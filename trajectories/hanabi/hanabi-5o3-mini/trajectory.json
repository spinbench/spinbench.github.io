In contrast, card 3 includes 1 as a possibility, which means it might be playable if it's green, white or blue (as those stacks need a 1). With no info tokens available to safely hint and plenty of play opportunities on my teammates' hands, the best course is to discard one of my more risky cards to regain an info token.

Given that a mistaken play would cost a life and we can afford to lose one with 3 life tokens, it's still better to generate an info token to enable precise hinting in future turns. Discarding one of our completely ambiguous cards (card in position 0) minimizes risk and provides us an info token for improved communication later. Therefore, I choose to discard card 0.",

Looking at our hand, the two cards with known rank information (cards in positions 1 and 2, both showing 'X3') are interesting. Given the discards, each can only be R3, Y3, or W3. On the board the yellow firework is at 2 (so Y3 is playable) and the white firework is at 2 (so W3 is playable). Only if the card is R3 would it be unplayable (since red is at 1 and needs R2 next). Thus there is roughly a 2/3 chance that either card is immediately playable. Since playing a card is crucial for advancing our score\u2014and we already see other players with playable cards\u2014it is a good risk.

In order to recover an info token safely, I should discard a card that is unlikely to be the immediately needed card. Between card 1 (position 0) and cards 2 (position 1), 3 (position 2), and 4 (position 3), card 1 has a chance to be Y4 (the yellow card needed), so I want to keep it. The two cards with positions 1 and 2 are identical in their uncertainty (possibilities: R, G, W, B and any rank), and discarding one of them is less risky.
