        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

Since Blue requires a 1 to start, he can confidently play this card, advancing the Blue firework.  \n- This action uses an info token strategically to unlock a new firework sequence, increasing our potential score.  \n\nPrioritizing starting new fireworks early ensures we don’t bottleneck future plays and leverages all colors. This balances progression across fireworks while conserving life tokens."

Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters.

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

This directly informs them that the card is playable for the Red firework (currently at R1) and avoids ambiguity. \n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Urgency**: Red’s next required card is 2, which Player B holds. Playing it now progresses the firework and unlocks future plays (e.g., R3 in Player C’s hand).\n2. **Efficiency**: A number hint (2) is precise here since Player B’s R2 is the only 2 in their hand. This reduces confusion and guarantees a safe play.\n3. **Risk Mitigation**: Playing blindly from your own hand is risky without prior hints. Using an info token (3 available → 2 remaining) is a low-cost, high-reward action.\n\n**Action**:  \nTell Player B, “You have one card with number 2.” This ensures they play the R2 immediately, advancing the Red firework and maintaining momentum."

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

These 1s are essential for unlocking new colors.  \n2. **Efficiency**: A single hint about \"1\" reveals both playable cards. Player 2 can then prioritize playing the leftmost 1 (likely Y1) first, followed by B1, maximizing the value of one info token.  \n3. **Risk Mitigation**: Starting new colors early prevents losing 1s to discards and adds immediate points. Progressing existing colors (e.g., G3/W2) is valuable but less urgent since their 1s are already played.  \n4. **Resource Management**: With 2 info tokens remaining, this action preserves flexibility for future critical hints (e.g., guiding G3 or W2 plays later).  \n\n**Action**:  \n**Hint to Player 2**: \"You have two cards with the number 1.\"  \n\nThis ensures the team secures two foundational plays while efficiently using resources."

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

Bob holds W4, which is the next required card for the White firework (currently at W3). Highlighting White will signal him to play W4, advancing the White firework to 4. This action is critical because:\n\n1. **Urgency of Play**: W4 directly progresses the White sequence, which is already at a higher value (W3) compared to other colors like Blue (B1). Advancing White further increases the score and opens the possibility of playing W5 if available.\n2. **Efficient Hint**: Bob’s only White card is W4, so a color hint (\"White\") unambiguously identifies the playable card. This avoids ambiguity and ensures immediate action.\n3. **Strategic Impact**: Completing higher-numbered cards (like W4) is valuable, as they contribute more to the total score and are harder to replace if discarded.\n\n**Action**: Give Bob a **White** hint to trigger the play of W4."

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

Without a hint, they might discard it unknowingly, which would irreversibly lower the team’s maximum potential score.  \n- Highlighting White informs Player 1 that the rightmost card (W5) is White. Since White’s firework is at 0, they will recognize this as the critical 5 to save for later.  \n- This action prioritizes long-term success over immediate plays (like R2 or B1), as losing W5 would be catastrophic.  \n\n**Secondary Considerations:**  \n- Player 2’s R2 and B1 are playable soon and can be addressed in subsequent turns.  \n- Player 1’s Y1 is also playable but less urgent than safeguarding W5.  \n\nBy protecting W5 now, the team retains the chance to achieve a perfect score while allowing future turns to focus on advancing other fireworks."

You can choose from the following legal actions:\n\nThe legal actions are provided in a mapping of action identifiers to their descriptions:\n{0: '(Discard 0)', 1: '(Discard 1)', 2: '(Discard 2)', 3: '(Discard 3)', 4: '(Play 0)', 5: '(Play 1)', 6: '(Play 2)', 7: '(Play 3)'}\n\n(Reveal player +N color C): Give a hint about color C to the player who is N positions ahead of you.\n(Reveal player +N rank R): Give a hint about rank R to the player who is N positions ahead.\n(Play X): Play the card in position X from your hand.\n(Discard X): Discard the card in position X from your hand.\n\nBased on the annotated state and the list of legal actions, decide on the most appropriate move to make. Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks. Good luck!\n"
