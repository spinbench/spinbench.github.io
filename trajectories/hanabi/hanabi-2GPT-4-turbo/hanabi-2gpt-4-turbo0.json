        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "Given the scenario you've described for a game of Hanabi, here's how we might approach the game strategically:\n\n1. **Observing the Game State**: I'll start by assessing our current situation:\n   - **Life Tokens**: Understand how many wrong plays we can afford.\n   - **Info Tokens**: Check how many hints are available.\n   - **Fireworks**: Review the progress on each color to determine which cards are urgently needed.\n   - **Discards**: Know which cards have been discarded to gauge the probability of drawing needed cards.\n\n2. **Decision Making**:\n   - **Playing a Card**: If I am confident about the identity of a card in my hand, I will play the card. Confidence usually stems from the hints received and deducing which cards are not in other players’ hands.\n   - **Giving a Hint**: If I possess an info token, I will consider giving a useful hint. I’d prioritize hints that enable immediate plays or prevent discarding important cards. For instance, if we need a blue 2 to progress and I see a player with a blue 2, I'd hint about that color if the number isn't already obvious.\n   - **Discarding a Card**: If info tokens are low and playing a card carries risk (low confidence about its usefulness), I might discard a card that seems least likely to impact our success (e.g., numbers or colors that are already completed or well-progressed). This move also regenerates an info token, which is crucial for continuous teamwork.\n\n3. **Hint Efficiency**:\n   - Aim to give hints that maximize the amount of information transferred. For example, if a player has multiple cards of the same number or color, a hint covering all those cards is more efficient than a hint affecting only one card.\n   - Consider future plays when giving hints. Sometimes it’s worth it to hint about a card that cannot be immediately played but ensures a smoother sequence later on.\n\n4. **Strategic Discards**:\n   - Keep track of all discarded cards to avoid suggesting the play of a card that is no longer available in the draw pile.\n   - Decide on discards based on what will least likely disrupt the team’s ability to complete a firework.\n\n5. **Team Coordination and Memory**:\n   - Remember which hints have been given about what cards. This not only affects your own decisions but also helps you understand the potential reasoning behind teammates' actions.\n   - Coordinate plays based on the game's progress, adapting strategies as needed when new cards are drawn or critical cards are discarded.\n\n6. **Handling Low Info Tokens**:\n   - Encourage card plays and discards that are less risky when info tokens are low, to regain them for critical points in the game.\n\n7. **Endgame Considerations**:\n   - As the deck runs low, shift focus toward completing as many fireworks as possible, even if the perfect score becomes unattainable.\n\nBy leveraging these strategies and maintaining strong cooperative communication through valid hints, the team can maximize its chances of achieving a high score or even a perfect game in Hanabi."

        "content": "Given the current game state and the hand visibility of both players, we need to approach our turn with strategic foresight to maximize the score potential. Here's a breakdown of the steps and the decision-making process:\n\n### Review the Fireworks Progress:\n- **Red:** 1\n- **Yellow:** 0\n- **Green:** 0\n- **White:** 0\n- **Blue:** 0\n\n### Analyze Your Hand:\n- You do not have any information about the cards in your hand; all are marked as 'XX' with potential as 'RYGWB12345'.\n\n### Review Player +1's Hand:\n- **Visible Cards:**\n  - 'Y3' (No specific hint, but known could be 'RYGWB2345')\n  - 'G1' (Hinted as rank 1, could be 'RYGWB1')\n  - 'W1' (Hinted as rank 1, could be 'RYGWB1')\n  - 'B1' (Hinted as rank 1, could be 'RYGWB1')\n  - 'B1' (No specific hint, but known could be 'RYGWB12345')\n\n### Key Consideration:\n1. **Player +1's hand** has several cards that are pivotal to building the firework stacks immediately. There are three cards ('G1', 'W1', 'B1') which can be played right now since they are rank 1 and correspond to colors where the stacks haven't started.\n2. Given that there are a high number of Info Tokens (7 available) and the urgency to begin the colored stacks with '1s', the optimal move revolves around enabling Player +1 to play these cards safely.\n\n### Strategic Plan:\n- **Focus on Giving Hints:** Since you can see Player +1's hand, a direct hint to enable them to play is critical. Player +1 knows that 'G1', 'W1', and 'B1' are rank 1 but doesn't know their colors. Highlighting their colors can lead to immediate and risk-free card plays.\n\n#### Action Selection:\nGiven that Player +1 holds three cards that can be identified by color and can be immediately played:\n- 'G1', 'W1', 'B1'.\n- Use a hint to clarify the color of these cards. You would begin with 'G1' as it's the first in the list.\n\n- **Action:** '(Reveal player +1 color G)' (`12`)\n\nThis action is selected to directly empower Player +1 to play 'G1', thus advancing the green firework without incurring any risk, especially since there are sufficient info tokens. This play also keeps the gameplay moving forward efficiently and avoids wasting any resources or moves.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Enable Player +1 to play 'G1' by confirming its color, allowing for immediate score building in the green firework stack.\", \"action\": 12}\n```"

        "content": "Based on the current game state and reviewing the cards visible in your teammate's hand along with the fireworks progress, the most strategic move at this moment would be to give a hint that enables immediate card plays. This will efficiently use the information tokens and help advance the game.\n\nCurrently, your teammate has the cards 'Y3', 'W1', and 'B1' which are visible to you. With the fireworks as follows: R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0, the cards 'W1' and 'B1' are immediately playable, as they start the white and blue fireworks respectively.\n\nYour teammate already knows that the 'W1' and 'B1' cards are rank 1 (indicated by their known information). However, 'Y3' is not currently playable and requires either a Y1 or Y2 to be played first. Giving a color-based hint that targets only relevant and immediately playable cards would be ideal.\n\nThe ideal action here, therefore, would be to use a color hint to help your teammate identify that they have another 'B1' card, enabling two blue '1' cards to be played successively (since your teammate may not be aware of the rank on the second 'B1'). Since you already have a good amount of info tokens (six), using one for a critical hint is beneficial. \n\nThus, you can use the hint to reveal color 'B' to the teammate, which will simultaneously confirm their existing knowledge about the first 'B1' they already are aware is rank 1 and unveil the rank of the other 'B1', which is still ambiguous to them.\n\nLet's move forward with giving a color hint about 'B' to player +1.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Revealing color 'B' to player +1 allows them to know that they have two 'B1' cards, enabling them to play both, starting the blue firework sequence efficiently.\",\n  \"action\": 14\n}\n```"

This hint will ensure Player +1 plays the White 1 card correctly, increasing our score without risking a wrong play.\n\n### Chosen Action:\n- Give a hint about the rank 1 to Player +1, which will cover the W1 card definitely and can also check if any other rank 1 is in the hand that could be highlighted by the hint.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Providing a hint about rank 1 to Player +1 allows the immediate playing of the White 1 card onto the fireworks, increasing our score directly.

        "content": "Given the current situation in the game and observing the Player +1's hand, here are some strategic thoughts leading to the decision:\n\n1. **Assessing Playable Cards:**\n   - From Player +1's hand, the visible cards include:\n     - Y3, B1, Y4, G1, another Y3.\n     - Among these, the B1 card is known to Player +1 (both color and rank) and is currently playable since the B stack is at 1.\n\n2. **Goal of Action:**\n   - Player +1 has a card that can be played immediately (B1), which will advance the Blue firework to 2.\n   - It appears Player +1 is aware of the color and rank of B1, as it's the only card in their hand with known complete information.\n\n3. **Hint Utility:**\n   - Considering hints would be redundant for B1 as Player +1 knows fully about it.\n   - Other hints like color Y or rank 1 might be useful in the future for other cards, but not currently impactful compared to playing B1 directly.\n\n4. **Info Tokens and Life Tokens:**\n   - Since we have 4 info tokens, using one for a hint that doesn't directly lead to a play or prevent a discard isn't the most efficient. Playing a correct card that's fully known is a better immediate utility, also conserving tokens for critical hints later.\n\n5. **Playing the Card:**\n   - Since the B1 is known and playable, the optimal move is to play this card which increases our score with no risk of losing a life token.\n\nThus, the action I choose based on these considerations is to play the B1 card held by Player +1. This is executed by choosing the appropriate action from the list provided:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Playing B1 because it is known to be blue and is next in the sequence for the blue stack, thus directly contributing to our score.\", \"action\": 6}\n```"

You can choose from the following legal actions:\n\nThe legal actions are provided in a mapping of action identifiers to their descriptions:\n{0: '(Discard 0)', 1: '(Discard 1)', 2: '(Discard 2)', 3: '(Discard 3)', 4: '(Discard 4)', 5: '(Play 0)', 6: '(Play 1)', 7: '(Play 2)', 8: '(Play 3)', 9: '(Play 4)', 11: '(Reveal player +1 color Y)', 12: '(Reveal player +1 color G)', 14: '(Reveal player +1 color B)', 15: '(Reveal player +1 rank 1)', 17: '(Reveal player +1 rank 3)', 18: '(Reveal player +1 rank 4)'}\n\n(Reveal player +N color C): Give a hint about color C to the player who is N positions ahead of you.\n(Reveal player +N rank R): Give a hint about rank R to the player who is N positions ahead.\n(Play X): Play the card in position X from your hand.\n(Discard X): Discard the card in position X from your hand.\n\nBased on the annotated state and the list of legal actions, decide on the most appropriate move to make. Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters.

        "content": "Based on the given game state and available information, here's the thought process for determining the optimal move:\n\n1. **Current Game State Review**:\n   - Fireworks: R=2, Y=0, G=1, W=1, B=1.\n   - Player +1 has these cards visible to you: Y3, B1, Y4, G1, Y3.\n\n2. **Immediate Playable Cards**:\n   - Player +1 has a B1 visible and knows it is blue color, rank 1. As B1 is playable (because B0 is the current progress), this card should be played to advance the Blue firework.\n\n3. **Hints for Advancing Fireworks Efficiently**:\n   - Since B1 is known and playable by Player +1, no hint is needed for this. \n   - However, another critical and immediate playable card is missing a hint. For example, hinting the G1 (which is known by rank but could be any color) can confirm its play if it turns out to be a green.\n\n4. **Strategy Based on Tokens and Playability**:\n   - With 3 info tokens available, it is beneficial to use a hint rather than discarding if the hint directly leads to a playable card.\n   - Since B1 is already known and playable by Player +1, and the next step could be determining the exact card G1, a hint about the color of G1 (if indeed it's green) will ensure correct sequence play and safe advancement.\n\n5. **Optimal Action**:\n   - Give a hint regarding the color of G1 to confirm its identity. If it’s green, it can immediately be played in the next turn by Player +1. The action that supports this strategy is giving a hint about the color green: `(Reveal player +1 color G)`.\n\nExecuting this action will not only help in playing G1 (if it is green) but also maintain the efficiency of using info tokens for direct impact on firework progression. Here's the recommended action:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Reveal the color Green to Player +1 to confirm if G1 can be played, advancing the Green firework and maximizing play efficiency.\", \"action\": 12}\n```"

It's crucial to use hints wisely to ensure that the most critical plays can be made. Additional hints could be saved for clearer and safer play options in later turns.\n\nGiven this analysis, the safest play with a high potential for success is to play 'Card 3', hoping it is 'Y2'. This advances the yellow stack with minimal risk given the current information.\n\nTherefore, the chosen action in JSON format is:\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Playing Card 3 as it's known to be '2' and it can potentially be 'Y2', which is a necessary card for the current yellow stack which is at 0.\", \"action\": 7}\n```"

        "content": "Given the current game state and the contents of both your hand and your teammate's hand, here is the step-by-step thought process and the decision to take the most appropriate action:\n\n### Analyze Immediate Play Possibilities\n- **Your Hand**: You do not have any definitive information about the identities of your cards except color hints for some. The green (G) and red (R) cards in your hand are potentially playable if they are the next numbers in sequence (G3 and R3, respectively). However, you only know that Card 2 is green and Cards 3 and 4 are red. Specific ranks for these cards are unknown.\n- **Teammate's Hand**: Your teammate has clearly identifiable cards, and particularly 'G1', which is known to be both green and rank 1. The green firework stack is currently at G2, so G1 isn’t directly playable. Your teammate also has 'Y3' and 'Y4', but since the Y stack is at 0, none of these are immediately playable.\n\n### Evaluate Discard Options\n- With zero info tokens available, no new hints can be given.\n- Discarding could be the next viable option to regain an info token, crucial for giving hints in subsequent turns.\n\n### Choose the Best Card to Discard\n- Considering your hand, discarding a potentially critical card like a 'G3' or 'R3' poses a risk of inhibiting progress.\n- Card 1 and Card 5 in your hand are the least definitively known and could be safer to discard since they don't have any definitive attribute revealed yet.\n- Prior to discarding, though, it’s wise to remember your game's state. Your teammate's hand does not have a Y1 visible, so any Y1 in your hand would be vital. However, discarding a card that potentially may not be immediately needed (like 'YWB1345' or 'YGWB12345') could be safer.\n\n### Decision:\nDiscard a card that has the least potential for immediate use and gains an information token, which is critical to guide future turns effectively.\n\n### Selected Action:\nDiscard Card 1, which you have no concrete information about. This will allow your team to gain an info token while minimizing the risk of discarding a card essential for immediate firework completion.\n\nHere's the output in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Selected to discard Card 1 to regain an info token, minimizing risk by discarding a card with the least information and unclear utility.\", \"action\": 0}\n```"

Since the green stack is at 2 and 'G1' has already been played, this card is not immediately needed.\n   - They also have 'Y3' and 'Y4', but the yellow stack is at 0, meaning 'Y1' would be the needed card.\n   - They hold a 'G3', and since the green stack is at 2, 'G3' is immediately playable. However, Player +1 has no specific hints indicating they can confidently play this card.\n\n3. **Hint Opportunities**:\n   - You do not have any info tokens available for giving hints. Thus, you cannot directly influence Player +1's decision to play 'G3' at this time.\n\n4. **Discard or Play from Your Hand**:\n   - Playing 'R3' from your hand is a guaranteed correct play since it perfectly follows the red stack which is currently at 2.\n\n5. **Selecting the Best Action**:\n   - Given the constraints and the available information, your best move is to play 'R3' (which is in position 1 in your hand). This action would not only score a point by advancing the red firework stack but also prevent the use of a life token from an incorrect guess.\n\nLet's formulate the output as required:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Playing 'R3' is the safest and most strategic move as it correctly builds on the red firework stack, which is currently at 2.\", \"action\": 6}\n```"

        "content": "Based on the current game state and the cards in both players' hands, let's evaluate the best strategic move:\n\n1. **Evaluating Playable Cards in Your Hand**:\n   - **Card 1 (GX, Possible: G145)**: The current Green stack is at G2. G1 is played (from the other player's hand analysis), thus G3 is the next playable for green, which could potentially be your card.\n   - **Card 2 (RX, Possible: R145)**: The Red stack is at R3, so R4 is next in sequence. Since R4 is one of the possible identities of this card, it can potentially be played.\n   - **Cards 3 and 4 (Rank 3)**: No clear indication they can be safely played since R3, G3 are covered, but Y3 is discarded, and W3 isn't immediately necessary as W1 is the highest white.\n   - **Card 5**: With no hints, the play is too risky.\n\n2. **Teammate's Hand Analysis**:\n   - The teammate has a **'G1'** which is already known entirely and can be played safely as it will extend the Green stack. However, your analysis sees it's already known to them.\n   - They hold a **'R4'** but no hints are given to them concerning its identity. This is a critical card since the red stack needs R4 next.\n\n3. **Hinting Strategy**:\n   - Since there is only 1 info token available and playing a correct card is crucial here, you should focus on enabling the right plays with available hints.\n   - A valuable hint would be revealing 'R4' to your teammate, but you lack a specific hint action that only reveals 'R4'. The available hint actions cover multiple cards at once, which might not be efficient given our limited tokens.\n\n4. **Deciding the Move**:\n   - The best immediate action with the highest certainty and use of resources would be to play your **Card 2**, which has a high likelihood of being 'R4', the next required card in the red sequence. This uses no tokens and potentially scores immediately.\n\nIn summary, based on analyzing the risk and benefits of available actions, playing Card 2, which could likely be 'R4', is a safe and potentially score-earning move. There's a significant chance it's the correct card needed, and it doesn't waste our precious remaining info token.\n\nHere is the decision in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Card 2 in your hand is likely R4, which is the next needed card in the Red sequence. Playing it is a direct opportunity to score without using up the last info token.\", \"action\": 6}\n```"

        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "During the game of Hanabi, I'll focus on providing strategic advice and considerations that can help you and your team achieve the highest possible score. Here are some steps and strategies to guide you through your game:\n\n1. **Survey the Current Game State**: \n   - Check the life tokens and info tokens.\n   - Observe the fireworks' current state (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\n   - Identify what colors and numbers are needed next.\n\n2. **Plan Your Action**:\n   - If info tokens are available, consider giving a hint. Choose hints that can maximize the potential for correct plays—prioritize hints about cards that can be immediately played or need attention to avoid accidental discards.\n   - If no info tokens are available or if your hand contains cards you believe to be low in value (e.g., duplicate numbers/colors already played or visible in other players' hands), consider discarding a card to regain an info token.\n\n3. **Executing Actions**:\n   - **Playing a Card**: Only play a card if you are confident it fits the next sequence. Use the information received from hints and your deductions based on the game state.\n   - **Giving a Hint**: Focus your hints on either a specific number or color that helps teammates play or retain critical cards. For instance, if you notice a teammate holding a '2' of a color that has a '1' already played, point out the '2' if it’s not yet common knowledge.\n   - **Discarding a Card**: Choose to discard cards that are least likely to be needed. This often includes high numbers when the lower ones haven’t been played yet, or duplicates of cards already successfully played.\n\n4. **Team Coordination**:\n   - While you can’t speak out of turn or indicate anything about your own cards directly, play close attention to the hints given by others and the timing of those hints. Often, the implication of urgency or priority can guide your assumptions about your own cards.\n   - Observe cards discarded by teammates to improve your guess about your own hand and what might still be needed.\n\n5. **Adjust Strategy Based on Game Progress**:\n   - If nearing the end of the deck, shift priorities towards playing as many cards as possible to maximize points.\n   - If life tokens are low, be more conservative with plays to avoid mistaken plays that would end the game.\n\n6. **Final Rounds**:\n   - When the deck is exhausted, each player will have only one final turn. Make the most of these by playing the highest value cards and using any remaining hints to secure last-minute points.\n\nBy following these strategies, maintaining awareness of both the overall game state and the details of available hints, and coordinating implicitly with your teammates, you'll enhance your chance of getting a high or even perfect score in Hanabi. Remember, the aim is not only to avoid mistakes but also to make the most strategic plays possible given the limited information available."

        "content": "Given the current state of the game and the information available, here's a step-by-step evaluation leading to a strategic decision:\n\n1. **Evaluate Playable Cards in Hand**: \n   - You know that Cards 2, 3, 4, and 5 in your hand are all rank 1, but you don’t know their colors. Since all firework stacks are at zero, any of these could potentially be played. However, playing one randomly risks a wrong play and loss of a life token.\n\n2. **Teammate's Hand Analysis**:\n   - The cards in Player +1's hand that stand out include 'R2', 'G5', 'G2', 'B2'. None of these can be played immediately, but knowing the colors of the 1s in your hand could make certain plays safe. \n\n3. **Hint Options**:\n   - Since you hold four 1-ranked cards that you might potentially play, giving a hint to Player +1 may not be as immediately beneficial as clarifying which of your own 1-ranked cards can be safely played.\n   - You have a sufficient number of info tokens (7), so using one to gain clarity for a safe and effective play would be wise.\n\n4. **Action Decision**:\n   - A hint about the colors of the 1s in your hand would be advantageous but is not an available option since you can’t hint to yourself. Therefore, it’s strategic to play one of the 1s, banking on the high probability it is correct due to the fact that no 1s have been played and there are five possible colors.\n\n5. **Chosen Action**:\n   - Considering the safe guess and potential high reward, the action to play one of the 1s would be chosen. Specifically, playing Card 2 seems reasonable since if it fails, it will help narrow down the possible successful plays for subsequent turns, and it only risks one life token while potentially adding to the fireworks.\n\nHere's the decision in the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Playing a 1-ranked card since no fireworks have been started and holding four possible 1s increases the likelihood of a correct play without specific color knowledge. High potential reward with controlled risk.\",\n  \"action\": 6\n}\n```\n\nThis play maximizes potential gain while using the current info effectively, given that all fireworks are at zero and you hold multiple 1s which are needed to start any firework."

        "content": "Given the current state of the game and the information available about both your own and your teammate's cards, here are the steps and analysis to decide on the best move:\n\n1. **Evaluate Playable Cards in Your Hand:**\n   - You have known hints for Card 2 ('X1' indicating it is a rank 1 card) and Card 3 ('B1' indicating it is a blue rank 1 card). Given that the blue stack is currently at 1, the 'B1' card is redundant. The 'X1' cards are potential candidates for other colors that still require the 1, specifically yellow and white, as red and green already have a '1' played.\n\n2. **Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities:**\n   - Your teammate holds cards 'W4', 'R2', 'G5', 'G2', and 'B2'. You can see that 'R2' and 'G2' are immediately playable based on the current fireworks' state (R1 and G1 respectively). Therefore, giving hints that would help them realize these cards' values would be crucial. However, no action token is available specifically for ‘R2’ which restricts that as a direct hint currently.\n\n3. **Assess Discard Options:**\n   - Card 3 ('B1'), already known to be redundant, stands out as a possible discard option to regain an Info token for later use. However, playing a known playable card is typically preferable when possible.\n\n4. **Strategic Decision:**\n   - Given the known redundancy of Card 3 ('B1'), the best strategic move would typically be to discard this card to recover an Info token for future hints since it adds no value to the fireworks stacks. However, since the game state allows for the immediate play of Card 2 which is known to be a '1' and likely required for Yellow or White (both of which are at 0), playing this card becomes the priority. Playing a potentially useful card outweighs the benefit of recovering an Info token in this context. This also avoids the risk of discarding a potentially needed '1' card if the guess on the colors was incorrect.\n\nTherefore, I recommend the following move:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Card 2 is known to be a rank 1, which is needed for the Yellow and White stacks that are both currently at 0. Since playing correct cards is the immediate goal to score, I choose to play this card to potentially complete the needed sequence in either Yellow or White color.\", \"action\": 6}\n```"

With the Green stack (G) at 1 and Blue stack (B) at 1, both G2 and B2 are sequentially playable.\n\n### Optimal Move Selection\nFrom this information:\n- **G2** in Player +1’s hand can be played because the Green stack is currently at 1 (G1). The player knows the rank but may not remember the color is Green. \n- **B2** is also playable sequentially right after B1 gets played. To ensure Player +1 knows B2 is blue, a hint could clarify that.\n\nGiven you have 2 info tokens, it would be most efficient to hint about the rank or color to Player +1, ensuring that G2 and B2 get played in the coming turns. You don't need to play or discard a card right now because helping your teammate play their cards correctly is a higher priority.\n\n### Recommended Action\nProvide a hint to Player +1 about the color Green (to reconfirm that the G2 is green and playable):\n- This maximizes the utility of the hint, ensuring Player +1 plays G2 safely.\n- Additionally, Player +1 has another G card (G5), and reinforcing the color might help plan for future turns.\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Providing a color hint for Green to Player +1 maximizes immediate play opportunities for G2 and is a strategic use of an info token, contributing directly to scoring points by extending the Green stack.\", \"action\": 12}\n```\n\nThis action uses an info token wisely, encourages a correct play on the next turn, and sets up the team for a smooth sequence execution without risking an incorrect play or wasting a card via discard."

        "content": "Given the current state of the game and the card information available, here's a step-by-step analysis to decide the most strategic move:\n\n1. **Evaluate Your Hand**: \n   - Card 3 in your hand is a 'G1' (known from hints). However, since the 'G' stack is already at 2, this card is not immediately playable and should not be discarded as it's still needed to complete the green stack.\n\n2. **Consider Teammates' Hands**:\n   - You observe multiple cards which are either not immediately required or have the potential to be mistakenly played:\n     - 'W4' and 'W3' are not playable (White stack at 1).\n     - 'G5' cannot be played until all other green cards (G3, G4) have been played.\n     - The 'R1' card in your teammate's hand is a critical card because it hasn't been played to the fireworks yet.\n\n3. **Assess Discard Options**:\n   - Discarding might help gain an Info token for future plays but should be considered carefully to avoid losing potentially valuable cards.\n\n4. **Hint Opportunities**:\n   - It is crucial to ensure that the 'R1' in your teammate's hand is played next. Since there is 1 info token available and no hints currently point to the 'R1', giving a hint about 'R' to your teammate would directly allow them to play the 'R1' card.\n\nBased on the above considerations:\n- Hinting the color 'R' to your teammate is the most beneficial action. It enables your teammate to correctly play 'R1', advancing the red stack without risking a mistake.\n- This move not only makes progress in the game but also avoids discards that could potentially remove needed cards prematurely or waste the remaining life tokens.\n\nTherefore, the recommended action is:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Hinting 'R' to ensure the correct play of 'R1' by teammate, advancing the red stack and making effective use of the available info token.\", \"action\": 10}\n```"

Notably, R3 can be played immediately as R2 has been played.\n\n2. **Consider Hint Opportunities**:\n   - With 1 info token, giving a hint can be very strategic. The best use of the hint is to help your teammate play a necessary card.\n   - R3 in your teammate’s hand can be immediately played. However, your teammate seems aware it's a red card but might confuse it with R1 or R4. A rank hint specifying '3' would clarify and enable them to play R3 confidently.\n\n3. **Assess Discard Options**:\n   - Discarding could be an option to regain info tokens for future rounds. However, given that there's a card that can be played immediately (teammate's R3), using the hint more directly contributes to scoring points.\n\n4. **Chosen Action**:\n   - The best action is to give a rank '3' hint to your teammate, ensuring they know that their card which could be R3 is indeed R3. This prompt action lets you score the R3 card now, which is crucial for advancing the fireworks.\n\nThus, the final decision based on all considerations is:\n\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Enable teammate to immediately play R3, which is critical for advancing the Red firework stack. Providing a rank hint is optimal given our current info token limit and the immediate playability of the hinted card.\", \"action\": 17}\n```"

Currently, the Green stack is at G2 in the fireworks progression, making this card unplayable for now.\n\n2. **Evaluate Teammate's Hand**:\n   - Your teammate has a \"R1\". Since the Red stack is at R3, this card is not immediately useful.\n   - They also have a \"W3\", and knowing that the White stack is at W1, this card can be played to progress the fireworks. However, the player only knows it's a rank 3, without knowing its color. Thus, they may not know that it's playable.\n\n3. **No Info Tokens**:\n   - You currently have no info tokens. Therefore, giving a hint is not an option without first discarding a card to gain an info token.\n\n4. **Discarding Options**:\n   - Cards in your hand except the \"G1\" have no specific hints, making them potentially safer choices for discarding. However, it is crucial to choose a card that is least likely to affect the game negatively if discarded.\n\n5. **Strategic Discard**:\n   - Discarding a card to gain an info token is necessary to communicate to your teammate that the \"W3\" they hold is playable and critical.

Since the descriptions are the same for the first two cards and they both carry identical potential identities as well as risks/benefits, discarding either should have an equivalent outcome.\n\nTherefore, the best action now is to discard one of these cards to gain an information token and in the next turn, help your teammate realize the playability of the \"W3\".\n\nYour output would look like this:\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Chose to discard Card 0 to regain an info token, allowing a future hint to inform the teammate about the playability of their W3.\", \"action\": 0}\n```"

However, since this card is incorrect (Green 1 where we need Green 3), playing it will cost a life.\n- **Card 3 - Card 5:** No valuable hints; potential identities too broad.\n\n### Analysis of Teammate's Hand:\n- **'G5'**: This card is a potential future play but currently blocked as 'G3' has not been played yet.\n- **'W3'**: Playable immediately. The White stack is at 'W1', and playing 'W2' (unseen) then 'W3' is the correct sequence.\n- **'B3', 'W1', 'R2'**: These cards are not immediately playable or need specific conditions to be safe plays.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\nWith only 1 life token remaining, a mistake in playing a wrong card leads directly to game over. Thus, the priority should be to facilitate correct plays without risk. \n\n- **Action 'Play 1'** is misinformed and would result in losing the game since it is a Green 1 and doesn't follow the sequential order from Green 2.\n- Hints to your teammate would be valuable, but there’s only 1 info token, and it must be used wisely.\n- The most beneficial action that ensures progress and uses current resources efficiently is to help your teammate play the White 3 card, which they might not recognize as playable due to its potential identities.\n\n### Best Move:\nGuide your teammate to play 'W3' as it aligns with the White firework progress and maximizes the score opportunity without risking a mistake. Given the existing knowledge, the teammate knows 'W3' can belong to several colors (YGWB3), but clarifying that it's White ensures a safe play and avoids confusion.\n\n### Decision:\n```json\n{\"reason\": \"Giving a hint about the color White to ensure the teammate knows 'W3' is playable and correct, using our limited info token to prevent a loss from an incorrect play and advance the White firework stack.\", \"action\": 13}\n```\n\nThis strategic hint secures a successful play and preserves the last life token by avoiding potential errors."
