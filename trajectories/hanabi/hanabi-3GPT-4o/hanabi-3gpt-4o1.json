        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

None can be safely played given the current firework state (R0, Y0, G0, W0, B1).\n- The B stack is at 1, but I lack definite information about having a blue card numbered 2.\n\n### Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\n- Player +1 has a 'Y1' and 'R1', both of which are currently playable.\n- Player +2 has a 'B1' and 'R1', with the 'B1' already played and the 'R1' still required.\n\n### Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\n- Discarding my cards seems risky without more information; however, with only three info tokens, we should be mindful of opportunities to replenish them strategically.\n\n### Optimal Move\n- The primary goal is to help players with cards they can play immediately since they contribute points. Therefore, providing a hint about the most immediately useful card for progress is valuable.\n- Revealing the rank 1 to Player +1 will allow them to play two cards ('Y1' and 'R1').\n\nConsidering all of these aspects, I believe the best move is to give a rank 1 hint to Player +1.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Player +1 has both 'Y1' and 'R1' which are needed to begin the yellow and red fireworks, respectively.

Since the yellow stack is at 1 and the Yellow 2 is not present elsewhere, this card might be Y2 and thus playable.\n2. **Card 4 (Rank 1):** Since you know it's rank 1, it could be R1, G1, W1, or B1. R1 and B1 have already been played, so we only need to check G1 or W1. Given neither G1 nor W1 is played or discarded yet, Card 4 is potentially playable, but we have no hints about its color.\n\n### Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\n- Player +1 holds a W2 and Y5; neither can be played immediately.\n- Player +2 holds a B1 (playable), R1 (playable), B3, Y2 (important), and G4. They already know about their rank 1 cards.\n\n### Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\nWith 0 info tokens, we are in a position where gaining a token is needed to continue giving helpful hints in the upcoming turns. \n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the urgency to conserve the last life token and the need for info tokens, the best option appears to be discarding a card with the least likelihood of immediate use. Based on possibilities and unknown information:\n\n- **Card 2** and **Card 3** are mostly unknown (could be RGWB2345), and with no immediate hint or stack progression tied to them.\n\n- **Action:** Discarding one of these cards will regain an info token without great immediate risk.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would recommend discarding the card in the second position of your hand (Card 2).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"We need to gain an info token to enable more hints, and Card 2 has no current known information making it a safe choice to discard.\",\n  \"action\": 1\n}\n```"

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

Play a Card\n\n### Decision-Making\nLet's choose a strategic move based on the visible cards and game goals.\n\n#### Option 1: Give a Hint\n- **Objective**: Provide valuable information to help another player play a card or avoid discarding crucial ones.\n\nYou can hint Player 2 about the G1 card, which is the first card needed for the green firework. Since we have plenty of info tokens, giving this hint is a strategic move to start the green fireworks and allow us to focus on other colors.\n\n**Hint Given**: To Player 2 - \"Green\" (indicating the position of the G1 card).\n\n#### Updated Game State\n- **Life Tokens**: 3\n- **Info Tokens**: 7 (after using one for a hint)\n- **Fireworks**: R0, Y0, G0, W0, B0\n- **Discards**: Still empty\n\nNow it's Player 2's turn.

Rank 1 cards are always safe to play since they start the fireworks. So, you can safely play any of these cards without risk.\n\n### Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\nPlayer +1 has a B1 and an R1 in their hand, both of which can be played. Player +2 has a Y1 and a B1, both of which can also be played. Providing hints to them about rank 1 would be beneficial, but since you have playable cards, it's usually best to prioritize playing them first.\n\n### Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\nSince cards 3, 4, and 5 are definitely rank 1, they are better played than discarded. Therefore, you should not discard on this turn.\n\n### Decision\nGiven that cards 3, 4, and 5 are all potential rank 1 cards, playing one of these cards is a safe move and helps advance the fireworks:\n\n- **Action Chosen**: Play the card at position 3 since it's confirmed to be a rank 1 card.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Playing card at position 3 is a safe move as it's determined to be a rank 1 card, initiating one of the fireworks without risk.\",\n  \"action\": 7\n}\n```"

The Y stack is already at 1, and the B stack is at 1 too, but those don't affect X1.\n  \n### Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\n- **Player +1**: Has R1 and B1, both of which can be played to further fireworks. Hinting about \"rank 1\" would be beneficial.\n- **Player +2**: G1 is also a valid card to play.\n\n### Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\n- We only have 1 info token, so it is crucial to use it wisely. Discarding doesn't seem optimal as we have a potential safe play with Card 3.\n\n### Decision\nPlaying Card 3 appears to be the safest and most effective action, allowing us to possibly score a point by extending the firework stacks.

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

Let's go through the logical steps you might take during your turn.\n\n### Strategic Priorities:\n\n1. **Utilize Info Tokens Wisely:**\n   - Give hints to enable the highest probability of correct plays.\n   - Prioritize hints that allow a guaranteed play or prevent discards of critical cards, like 1s or 5s.\n\n2. **Manage Life Tokens:**\n   - Avoid risky plays that might result in incorrect card placement, especially when life tokens are low.\n\n3. **Advance the Fireworks:**\n   - Playing cards in order of ascending sequence is critical. Focus first on playing 1s, then 2s, and so on.\n\n4. **Recycle Cards Using Discards:**\n   - Discard non-critical cards when necessary to gain more info tokens, especially when hints have run out.\n\n### Making Your Move:\n\n1. **Assess the Game State:**\n   - Count available info and life tokens.\n   - Check the progression of each firework color.\n   - Note important discards that might restrict future plays.\n\n2. **Observe Teammate’s Cards:**\n   - Evaluate what information your teammates might need to play their cards effectively.\n   - Consider what they might do on their turn given the current information.\n\n3. **Decide Your Action:**\n   - **Give a Hint:**\n     - Choose a hint that advances the current game strategy. For instance, if it's safe to play a certain number or color for a teammate, inform them.\n   - **Discard a Card:**\n     - If info tokens are low and no obvious hint is valuable, discard a card that’s less likely to be needed soon.\n   - **Play a Card:**\n     - Based on hints received, if you believe a card in your hand can be played safely, proceed with that play.\n\n### Example Decision-Making:\n\n- **You have enough info tokens:**\n  - Hint a teammate about a \"1\" they hold, enabling them to start a new firework.\n\n- **Info tokens are low:**\n  - If a safe discard can restore an info token without risking a critical card, do so.\n\n- **You suspect a card is playable:**\n  - Based on previous hints, if you deduce a card in your hand completes the next step in the sequence, play it.\n\n### Communication and Collaboration:\n\n- Encourage your teammates to provide hints that maintain the natural flow of play.\n- React adaptively as you gather more data from others’ hints and their actions.\n\nFeel free to describe the current game state or specific scenario if you want advice on a particular move!"

        "content": "Let's examine the situation and decide on the best course of action.\n\n### Evaluate Playable Cards in Hand\n\n- Based on the hints you have received for cards in your hand (cards 1 and 2 could be rank 1), and the state of the fireworks (only B1 has been played), playing one of these may be a good move. Since there are no specific hints that differentiate between card 1 and card 2, and either could be one of the rank 1 cards, you can choose to play one of them, hoping it contributes to starting a new firework.\n\n### Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\n\n- **Player +1** has important cards: `Y1`, `B1`, and they can already play B1 since B stack is at 1. Player +1 also has `Y1` which is crucial since Y is not yet started, so it's important to reveal that rank or color to them.\n- **Player +2** has a `Y1` and a `R1` that can be played immediately. Revealing the rank 1 to them could help them play `R1`, which will advance the fireworks.\n\nChoosing to reveal a hint that allows for immediate play might be more strategic than taking a chance on playing a card from your own hand, especially since revealing would still leave you with 3 info tokens remaining.\n\n### Recommended Action\n\nGiving Player +1 the hint about color Y ensures that they know they have a `Y1` to start that firework without guessing, which is a critical first step and a relatively safe move.\n\nHere's the recommended action:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Revealing Player +1's color Y will enable them to play Y1, which is important because no Y has been played yet.\",\n  \"action\": 11\n}\n```"

The stacks for R and B already have 1, but stacks for G, W, or Y might need a 1. In absence of color hints, playing could be risky.\n- **Card 3, 4, and 5:** No information has been provided about these cards, making them potential discard candidates.\n\n### Teammates' Hands:\n\n- **Player +1:** Holds a G1 that is immediately playable as the G stack is at 0. However, no info tokens are available to hint this.\n- **Player +2:** Holds a W2 that is currently unplayable as the W stack hasn't started yet.\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n\n1. Since there are no info tokens available, a discard must happen to gain one.\n2. Card 3, 4, and 5 are potential discard options, with no direct hints on them.\n3. Avoid discarding 1s if possible, as they are crucial for initiating stacks.\n\nGiven the above analysis, **Card 3** seems like the best candidate to discard, as it has no known information and thus presents the least risk in terms of potentially discarding a critical card.\n\n### Decision:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"reason\": \"With no info tokens available, a discard is needed. Choosing to discard Card 3 as it has no hints and is less likely to be crucial, freeing up an info token for essential hints later.\",\n    \"action\": 2\n}\n```\n\nThis decision aims to replenish an info token while minimizing the risk of losing a critical card necessary for advancing the game state."

Here's what you observe:\n\nPlayer +1's hand:\n - A card: You can see the card: 'Y4', This player knows the card might be: yellow color, This player knows the card could be one of the following: Y2345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'W4', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RW2345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'B2', This player knows the card might be: blue color, This player knows the card could be one of the following: B2345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'G2', This player knows the card might be: green color, This player knows the card could be one of the following: G12345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'Y4', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGW12345.\n\nPlayer +2's hand:\n - A card: You can see the card: 'W2', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB2345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'Y5', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB2345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'G5', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB2345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'R4', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n - A card: You can see the card: 'G4', This player has no specific hints about the card's identity, This player knows the card could be one of the following: RYGWB12345.\n\nThere are 26 cards remaining in the deck.\nDiscard pile: Y1 Y3 B1 R2 B3.\n\n\n\n\nPlease think step by step based on the current state\n\t\n# Think step by step\n\n## Evaluate Playable Cards in Hand\n\nLook at each card in your hand.\nCross-reference with the current game state to see if any card can be immediately played to complete or extend a firework stack.\nConsider hints you have received about each card (color/rank information) to determine if it might be safe to play.\nIf a card can be played without risk, prioritize playing it to score a point.\n\n## Consider Teammates' Hands and Hint Opportunities\n\nAnalyze the visible cards in your teammates' hands.\nIdentify if any of their cards can now be played based on the current firework stacks or previous hints.\nIf you notice a teammate holds a card that can be played but they may not realize it, think about what hints you could give them.\nUse hints to communicate critical information, such as color or rank, to help them make the right play.\nChoose the hint that maximizes the chance for a correct play while considering the limited hint tokens.\n\n## Assess Discard Options to Gain Info Tokens\n\nLook for cards in your hand that are least likely to be playable or helpful in the near future.\nConsider the remaining deck composition and cards already played/discarded to predict the value of each card.\nDiscard a card that you believe to be least useful to gain an Info token, especially if no immediate playable or hint options are available.\nEnsure that discarding this card won't permanently remove a critical card needed to complete any firework stack.\n\nNow it's your turn. You can choose from the following legal actions:\n\nThe legal actions are provided in a mapping of action identifiers to their descriptions:\n{0: '(Discard 0)', 1: '(Discard 1)', 2: '(Discard 2)', 3: '(Discard 3)', 4: '(Discard 4)', 5: '(Play 0)', 6: '(Play 1)', 7: '(Play 2)', 8: '(Play 3)', 9: '(Play 4)'}\n\n(Reveal player +N color C): Give a hint about color C to the player who is N positions ahead of you.\n(Reveal player +N rank R): Give a hint about rank R to the player who is N positions ahead.\n(Play X): Play the card in position X from your hand.\n(Discard X): Discard the card in position X from your hand.\n\nBased on the annotated state and the list of legal actions, decide on the most appropriate move to make. Consider factors like current tokens, firework progress, and information available in hands. Then, output one of the legal action descriptions as your chosen action.\n\nYour output should be in this format: \n{\"reason\": string, \"action\": int} And the action should be one of the legal actions provided above.\nYou can only use json valid characters. When you write json, all the elements (including all the keys and values) should be enclosed in double quotes!!!\n\nTo win, you need to play the cards in the correct sequence and maximize the total score of the fireworks. Good luck!\n"

        "content": "To make an informed decision, let's carefully analyze the current situation:\n\n### Game State Analysis:\n\n- **Firework Progress:**\n  - R1, Y1, G1, W0, B1\n\n- **Info Tokens:** 0 (We cannot give any hints currently)\n- **Life Tokens:** 1 (Be cautious with risky plays)\n- **Discards:** Y1, Y3, B1, R2, B3\n\n### Your Hand Review:\n\n1. **Card 1 & 2: Possible '1's:**\n   - Known as rank 1.\n   - Safe to play if they complete a firework stack.\n\n2. **Card 3:** Unknown, no clear action without clues or tokens.\n3. **Card 4 & 5:** Unknown, but potential discards since they have no information and no clear play.\n\n### Teammate Hand Review:\n\n- **Player +1:**\n  - B2 and G2 can be played soon, but we need tokens to give hints.\n  \n- **Player +2:**\n  - W2 can be played on the W stack, but again, we lack tokens to hint.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n\nWith 0 info tokens, we can't reveal any hints. The options are to play or discard one of our own cards.\n\n#### Decision:\n\nSince you have hints suggesting that Card 1 and Card 2 might be \"1\"s, and the B1 and Y1 have already been discarded, it is possible these could be a W1 or R1:\n\n- **Card 1 or 2 Attempt:** Play Card 1 or Card 2 as they might be a W1 or R1 based on discard analysis and current firework progress. W1 is not yet on the board, and we don’t have W1 discarded, so playing to achieve firework progress or risking only 1 life token for potential gain is advisable.\n\n### Recommended Action:\n\nTry playing Card 1, as it might be a \"1\" and can safely advance the fireworks progress given the current information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Card 1 is marked as potential rank 1. Since life tokens are low and no info tokens are available to give hints, playing this card has a chance to advance the W or R fireworks. Risking this play is our best tactical option.\",\n  \"action\": 5\n}\n```"
