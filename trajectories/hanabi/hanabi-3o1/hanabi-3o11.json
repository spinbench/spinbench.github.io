        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

Since you’ve outlined the key rules and my role, let’s prepare:\n\n1. I’ll assume we each have a certain hand of cards—but I cannot see my own.  \n2. I can see the other players’ hands.  \n3. On my turn, I can either:  \n   – Give a Hint (about color or number),  \n   – Discard a Card, or  \n   – Play a Card.  \n\nTo move forward, let me know the current game state (e.g., how many life and info tokens remain, what the visible hands are, and the firework progress so far), and we can begin taking turns. If you’d like a general strategic discussion first—such as best practices for providing hints or deciding on discards—feel free to let me know, and I’ll delve into that. Otherwise, I’m ready to “sit at the table” and start playing through the scenario!"

        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "Understood! Since the game and its rules have been laid out, the next step is typically to look at the specifics of the current state (hands, tokens, and fireworks progress) to decide on a move. If we don’t yet have a shared game state we can refer to, here are some general tips and principles that a “master” Hanabi player keeps in mind throughout a game:\n\n1) Value of Information Tokens:\n   • Info tokens are precious. Avoid giving generic hints that don’t meaningfully guide the next plays.\n   • Ideally, each hint should help set up an immediate or near-future play (e.g., informing a player that they have a playable “1” or that they hold the next needed card in sequence).\n\n2) Efficiency in Hints:\n   • Try to give multi-card hints when possible (for instance, pointing out that two cards in a player’s hand are red). This often helps your teammate reduce uncertainty about multiple cards at once.\n   • Number-based clues can help your teammate identify or distinguish important “5s” (which are rarer) or “1s” (crucial to kickstart each color).\n\n3) Tracking Known Discards & Visible Cards:\n   • Monitor which cards have been discarded—or when you see multiple copies of a number in teammates’ hands. This reduces guesswork about the contents of your own hand.\n   • If three copies of “2” of a certain color are visible (either played, held by teammates, or discarded), you know no further copies exist.\n\n4) Discard Timing:\n   • Discard to recover info tokens, but do it carefully. Discarding a card that might still be needed can jeopardize a perfect run.\n   • Smart discards can give you the tokens needed to continue valuable discussions via hints.\n\n5) Careful Plays:\n   • When you “play” a card (rather than discarding), you want to be fairly certain it’s playable to avoid losing a life token.\n   • Sometimes, if you’re one life token from game over, you’ll want certainty (or a direct hint from a teammate) that the card is correct.\n\n6) Communication Within Constraints:\n   • All communication must be strictly through color or number hints, and the timing and choice of hint can subtly convey which card is safe or urgent to play.\n   • Good teams build common “conventions” or patterns of giving hints, but be mindful that these cannot break the rules or transmit illegal extra information.\n\nIf you’d like to walk through a turn-by-turn scenario or go deeper into strategy for a particular game state, just lay out the hands (as you see them), any known card knowledge, and your current tokens and fireworks. Then we can discuss each possible move (give a hint, discard, or play) and examine how best to proceed."

        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Understood! I’m ready to help strategize and maximize the team’s final score. Since Hanabi is all about coordinating moves with intentionally limited information, the key to success is efficient communication—and nothing is more valuable than a well-used hint. Below is a general outline of a strong approach, but if you’d like something more specific, let me know the current board state (firework stacks, teammates’ visible hands, tokens remaining, etc.) and I can tailor the strategy further.\n\nGeneral Hanabi Strategic Overview:\n\n1) Prioritize Early Clues:\n   • Use initial Info tokens to identify critical cards (especially 1s, which must be played to start each color’s firework). \n   • A common approach is to hint “number 1” or the color of all 1s in someone’s hand early on, allowing them to safely play them to establish the base of the fireworks.\n\n2) Distinguish “Safe” Cards from “Unknowns”:\n   • Once a player knows they hold a specific playable card (for example, a known 1 in a color not yet started, or the next number in sequence), encourage them to play. \n   • A strategic discard can free up a hand slot, especially if the card is very unlikely to be needed soon (for instance, a duplicate of a number already placed or known to be in somebody else’s hand).\n\n3) Avoid Redundant Hints:\n   • Each clue should typically set up a teammate for an immediate or near-future play. Repetitive or partial hints that cannot provide clarity on how to act may waste Info tokens.\n\n4) Track Known Information Carefully:\n   • Even after a hint, keep “mental notes” of which cards have been identified and which remain mysteries. \n   • If you suspect a card might be the next number in a sequence, but the other players have not hinted it, it may well be too risky to play blind.\n\n5) Manage Tokens and Life:\n   • Strive to keep enough Info tokens on hand to ensure safe plays. \n   • Use discards to replenish Info tokens whenever the cost (discarding a card that might still be needed) is less risky than running out of hints.\n   • Avoid playing a truly unknown card unless the team has enough Life tokens to afford a mistake or it’s absolutely necessary near the endgame.\n\n6) Focus on Efficiency:\n   • In advanced strategies, clues can serve dual purposes—for example, giving a color hint that conveys not only which card to play but also (by elimination) which cards not to play.\n   • In many groups, specific conventions arise (like always assuming the leftmost hinted card is the safest to play first if not contradicted by other known info), but these must comply with the rule that all communication outside of color or number is disallowed in normal Hanabi play.\n\nWith clear, concise, and timely hints—plus disciplined discards—your team can progress the fireworks steadily and preserve Life tokens. If you can share your current situation (like which cards are visible, how many tokens remain, and the current state of each color’s firework), I can help plan optimal next moves."
