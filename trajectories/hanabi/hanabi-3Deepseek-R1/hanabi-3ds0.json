        "content": "\nYou are a master of hanabi game. You are playing a game of Hanabi. Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed. Work together, follow the rules, and aim for the highest cooperative score possible!\n"

        "content": "In the game of Hanabi, strategic collaboration and careful planning are essential. Here's a step-by-step approach based on the thought process:\n\n1. **Assess Fireworks Progress**: Check which colors need the next sequential number. Prioritize colors closest to completion or those with critical cards (e.g., 5s).\n\n2. **Evaluate Teammates' Hands**:\n   - Identify playable cards (e.g., a Blue 2 if Blue fireworks are at 1).\n   - Note duplicates, discards, and unrecoverable cards (e.g., if both Y2s are discarded, focus on other colors).\n\n3. **Action Decision**:\n   - **Give a Hint** if info tokens are available:\n     - Target the most urgent playable card (e.g., hint \"Green\" to a player holding G1 when Green is at 0).\n     - Use conventions (e.g., hinting a number might indicate the leftmost playable card).\n   - **Discard** if info tokens are low and your hand has non-critical cards (e.g., duplicates or unusable high numbers).\n   - **Play a Card** only if confident (e.g., if you received a hint like \"Red 1\" earlier and Red is at 0).\n\n4. **Risk Management**:\n   - Avoid plays that risk lives unless necessary (e.g., late-game urgency).\n   - Track discards to prevent losing key cards (e.g., saving the last 3 of a color).\n\n**Example Scenario**:\n- Fireworks: R2, B1, G0, Y0, W0.\n- Teammate B has G1 and B2. Teammate C has Y5.\n- Discards include Y2 and G3.\n\n**Optimal Move**:\n- **Hint Teammate B about \"Green\"** to signal their G1 is playable, starting the Green firework. This adds a new color and sets up future plays (e.g., G2 from another player).\n- Avoid discarding unless necessary, as info tokens (3) are sufficient for hints.\n- Reserve Y5 in Teammate Câ€™s hand via future hints once Yellow progresses.\n\n**Outcome**: Green firework begins, maximizing score potential while conserving resources."

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a series of fireworks by playing cards in ascending numerical order starting from 1. Each player holds their cards facing outward so that all players can see everyone else's cards but not their own. The objective is to play cards in sequence (1 through 5) for each color without making mistakes. There are 5 different colors and each color has cards numbered 1 to 5.\n\nKey Rules:\n\nOn your turn, you have three types of possible actions:\n\nGive a Hint(Reveal): Provide a hint to another player about their cards, specifying either a color or a number present in their hand. Hints must be accurate and can only reveal positions of cards matching the hint.\nDiscard a Card: Discard one of your own cards to potentially gain an Info token.\nPlay a Card: Attempt to play a card from your hand. If played correctly in sequence, it adds to the fireworks; if not, it reduces one life token.\n\nTokens:\nLife Tokens: Deducted when a wrong card is played.\nInfo Tokens: Used to give clues.\nIllegal Moves: Playing a card that cannot be placed properly costs a life token. If life tokens reach zero, the game ends in failure.\nGame End: The game ends when all fireworks are completed (perfect score of 25), or when the deck is exhausted and each player has taken one final turn, or when the players run out of life tokens.\n\nState Representation: The game state is represented with the following details:\n\nLife tokens: Number of remaining life tokens.\nInfo tokens: Number of available information tokens.\nFireworks: Current progress on each firework color (e.g., R1, Y0, G1, W0, B0).\nDiscards: Cards that have been discarded.\n\nYour Role:\n\nYou are one of the players, cooperating with others to maximize the total score of the fireworks (the number of cards correctly played in sequence).\nAlthough you cannot see your own cards, you can see the cards in the hands of your teammates.\nUse hints, discards, and plays strategically to guide the team towards successful sequences.\n\nRemember, communication is limited to hints about colors or numbers only, and sharing illegal or extraneous information is not allowed.

For example, if a red firework is at 1, the next needed card is red 2.\n2. **Teammates' Hands**: Check if teammates have playable cards. If a teammate has a card that is the next in the sequence, a hint about its color or number can prompt them to play it.\n3. **Info Tokens**: Use hints when necessary, but discard to regain info tokens if they are low.\n4. **Discards**: Avoid discarding critical cards needed for the sequence.\n5. **Life Tokens**: Be cautious with risky plays if life tokens are low.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best initial move is to provide a hint to a teammate about a playable card, ensuring the team progresses efficiently toward completing the fireworks.\n\n\\boxed{Give a hint to a teammate about a playable card in their hand, such as indicating the number or color needed for the next firework step.}"
