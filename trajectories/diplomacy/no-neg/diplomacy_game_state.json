          "content": "\nYou are playing a game of Diplomacy against 6 opponents. Diplomacy is a 7-player turn based game, where players must use negotiation and strategy to control the most supply centers on the map. The players can move their units to different locations on the map, and can support other players' units to help them succeed. The game is played on a map of Europe, divided into territories and sea zones. The players can issue orders to their units to move, support, hold, or convoy. The game ends when one player controls 18 supply centers.\n\n34 of the land provinces are supply centers. Possession of these supply centers allows the powers who control them to raise and maintain armies and fleets. As they are also a central part of the game's victory conditions, they are the focus of much of the game's activity.\n\nEach player is given three (save for Russia, which has four) home supply centers. These spaces are the starting point for their owning power's initial forces. The players can then build new units at these home supply centers as they capture further supply centers. New units can only be built on a power's home supply centers. If a power loses all of its home supply centers it may continue to play; however, it may not build new units until it has recaptured at least one of its home supply centers.\n\nIn Diplomacy, there are two types of units: Armies and Fleets. An army can travel in land spaces and coastal land spaces, and a fleet can travel in sea spaces and coastal land spaces.\n\nAll units in Diplomacy move only one space at a time and only one unit may occupy any space at any time. The exception to this rule comes in the form of a successful convoy, where a convoyed army may travel multiple spaces depending on the length of the chain created by the convoying fleets. A convoyed army must embark from a coastal land province and land at a coastal land province.\n\nDiplomacy proceeds by seasons, beginning in the year 1901, with each year divided into two main seasons: the \"Spring\" and \"Fall\" (Autumn) moves. Each season is further divided into negotiation and movement phases, followed by \"retreat\" or \"disband\" adjustments and an end-of-the-year Winter phase of new builds or removals following the Fall adjustments.\n                                  \nNegotiation phase\n\nIn the negotiation phase, players discuss tactics and strategy, form alliances, and share intelligence or spread disinformation. Negotiations may be made public or kept private. Players are not bound to anything they say or promise, and no agreements are enforceable.\nCommunication and trust are highly important; players must forge alliances with others and observe their actions to evaluate their trustworthiness. At the same time, they must convince others of their own trustworthiness while making plans to turn against their allies when least expected. A well-timed betrayal can be just as profitable as an enduring, reliable alliance.\n\nMovement phase\n\nAfter the negotiation period, players write secret orders for each unit; these orders are revealed and executed simultaneously. A unit can move from its location to an adjacent space, support an adjacent unit to hold an area in the event of an attack, support another unit to attack a space into which it could move itself, or hold defensively. In addition, fleets may transport armies from one coast space to another when in a chain called a \"convoy\". Armies may only occupy land regions, and fleets occupy sea regions and the land regions that border named seas. Only one unit may occupy each region. If multiple units are ordered to move to the same region, only the unit with the most support moves there. If two or more units have the same highest support, a standoff occurs and no units ordered to that region move. A unit ordered to give support that is attacked has those orders canceled and is forced to hold, except in the case that support is being given to a unit invading the region from which the attack originated (in which case the unit that had been ordered to give support must retreat from, rather than hold, its position).\nCertain spaces on the board have two coasts and here a player must specify which one they want their fleet to occupy. A fleet can only move to coasts and oceans that border the coast that it is on. For example, a fleet occupying the southern coast of Bulgaria cannot move into Romania or the Black Sea, but a fleet on the east coast could.\n\nIn the game of Diplomacy, an action space is the collection of all the legal actions that each country or unit can take in each round. The following are common types of actions in games and their common formats:\n\n1. Attack/Move\n\nThis order moves the unit in one province to an adjacent province. Of course, armies cannot move into sea provinces, and fleets cannot move into landlocked provinces.\n\nA unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere.\n\nTwo units may not swap provinces, unless there is a convoy involved. \n\nThe format is:\n\nA [province] - [target province] (Army moves from current position to target province)\nF [province] - [target province] (Fleet moves from current position to target province)\nFor example:\n\nA BER - MUN indicates that the army from Berlin moved to Munich.\nF NTH - ENG indicates the movement of the fleet from the North Sea (NTH) to the English Channel (ENG).\n\nWhen the destination province is occupied by another unit, they do not move, unless either are attacked or defended by stronger support. When two units with equal support try to move into the same destination province, for instance:\n\nGermany\nA MUN - TYR\n\nItaly\nA VEN - TYR\n\nNeither of the two units can go into Tyrolia. Army Venice will stay in Venice, and Army Munich will stay in Munich. Again, this is assuming that these two units are the only two units in this little battle, and that they have equal support for their moves.\n\n2. Support\n\nSupport is the trickiest aspect of the rules, and the most important of the game. Support may involve cooperation between two (or more) powers, and is the only way to make forward progress through enemy territory (unless you can convince the enemy to let you in). Simply put, more support defeats less support.\n\nThe support order is given in reference to another unit's move. That other unit's move must be to a province into which the supporting unit could otherwise move. Support may also be given to a unit holding its position. In addition, units giving support can themselves be supported in their holding position.\n\nSupport is a unit's sole action for a given move, and supporting units remain where they are (unless they are attacked by greater support and have to retreat or disband during the retreat phase).\n\nA country cannot dislodge or support the dislodgement of one of its own units, although if same country's units attempt to move into the same province with equal support, neither will succeed as normal.\n\nCutting Support: If the supporting unit is attacked during the turn by some other unit, its support is cut. In effect, the support order becomes a hold order, as the unit must defend its province against the attack. Note that a unit occupying the province into which the support is directed cannot cut support, unless its attack successfully dislodges the supporting unit. An attack by a country on one of its own units also doesn't cut support.\n\nThe format is:\n\nA [province] S A [target province] - [destination] (support army movement)\nA [province] S A [target province] (supporting the garrisoning of the army)\nF [province] S F [target province] - [destination] (Support fleet movement)\nF [province] S F [target province] (garrisoning of supporting fleet)\nFor example:\n\nA BER S A MUN indicated that the Army in Berlin supported the Army garrison in Munich.\nA BER S A MUN-KIE stated that the Army of Berlin supported the Army of Munich in moving to Kiel.\n\nOther example:\n\nNB: Below are complete orders as submitted by all 7 Powers for the Fall 1907 campaign season of a made-up game to help you understand the intricacies of supporting and breaking support. Having a game map to look on with is highly recommended; the one provided at the top of this page is adequate.\n\n\nWe'll start with:\n\n--Germany--\nArmy Ruhr to Holland\nFleet Kiel supports Army Ruhr to Holland\nArmy Munich supports Army Ruhr to Holland\nNote that in this case the order for Munich to support Ruhr into Holland would not work because Munich does not border Holland and thus cannot support Ruhr in (Munich could, however, support Ruhr if Ruhr were simply holding). The rule for supporting an attack is that a supporting unit must border the province being attacked, but need not border the attacker's province of origin (to support a unit to hold, however, the supporting unit must border the supported unit). Essentially, the supporting unit must border the destination of the supported unit, whether it is its own province or a new province entirely. In sum, Ruhr is actually attacking Holland with the support of only one unit (Fleet Kiel).\n\nArmy Prussia supports Army Silesia\nArmy Silesia supports Army Prussia\nHere, Army Prussia is supported by one unit, and Army Silesia is supported by one unit. The last two moves are legal, and this method of double-support is helpful when there are two units that both could be attacked and dislodged. Of course, if both units are attacked, the support fails.\n\n\n--England--\nArmy London to Holland\nFleet North Sea convoys Army London to Holland (<-- a convoy)\nFleet Heligoland Bight supports Army London to Holland\nNote that the convoying fleet is not considered to be giving support, so Army London actually has support from only one unit: Fleet Heligoland-Bight.\n\nArmy Denmark to Kiel\nHere England interferes with Germany's plans (see Germany, above) by attacking Kiel with Army Denmark. This cuts the support of Fleet Kiel to Army Ruhr, thereby leaving Army Ruhr's attack on Holland unsupported.\n\nArmy London, on the other hand, (see above) is supported in its attack on Holland by one unit (Fleet Heligoland-Bight), thereby enabling Army London to be convoyed successfully into Holland, as long as Fleet North Sea is not dislodged during the convoy.\n\nArmy Picardy to Brest\nFleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean supports Army Picardy to Brest\nFleet English Channel supports Army Picardy to Brest\nHere Army Picardy is supported by both Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean and Fleet English Channel to move into Brest. Unless the French successfully defend it, England will also take Brest.\n\n\n--France--\n\nFleet Gascony to Mid-Atlantic Ocean\nFleet Irish Sea to English Channel\nFleet Gascony and Fleet Irish Sea cut the support by Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean and Fleet English Channel for England's Army Picardy (see England, above). Therefore, Army Picardy is now attacking Brest unsupported.\n\nFleet Brest holds\nArmy Paris supports Fleet Brest\nArmy Paris supports Fleet Brest, and so Army Picardy\u2019s now unsupported attempt to move into Brest fails.\n\nArmy Burgundy to Ruhr\nArmy Burgundy does not successfully move into Ruhr because Army Ruhr\u2019s move to Holland failed (see Germany and England, above).\n\n\n--Russia--\n\nFleet Sevastopol holds\nArmy Moscow supports Fleet Sevastopol\n\nFleet Sevastopol is supported by Army Moscow.\n\nFleet St. Petersburg (North Coast) to Norway\nArmy Finland supports Fleet St. Petersburg (North Coast) to Norway\n\nNorway is not occupied, so Russia takes it immediately.\n\nArmy Livonia to Prussia\n\nUnsupported Army Livonia attempts to move into Prussia, but since Army Prussia is supported by Army Silesia (see Germany, above), the attack is not successful.\n\n\n--Austria-Hungary--\n\nArmy Ukraine supports Fleet Sevastopol\n\nArmy Ukraine supports Fleet Sevastopol, so there are now two units supporting (see Russia, above). In fact, international support is necessary in alliances, whether supporting each other in defence or to attack another Power.\n\nFleet Trieste holds\nArmy Budapest supports Fleet Trieste\nArmy Vienna supports Fleet Trieste\n\nThere are two units supporting Fleet Trieste: Army Budapest and Army Vienna.\n\n\n--Turkey--\n\nArmy Galicia to Ukraine\n\nArmy Galicia cuts the Austrian support to Sevastopol, thereby decreasing the support to Sevastopol by one unit (see Austria and Russia, above).\n\nFleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\nArmy Armenia supports Fleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\nArmy Rumania supports Fleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\n\nNow, since Fleet Black Sea is supported by two units into Sevastopol, Fleet Black Sea moves into Sevastopol, and Fleet Sevastopol has to be disbanded or retreat. A retreating fleet that is displaced by another force can only retreat into a movable space (i.e. a sea or coastal province that is vacant) which may not be the same space that was previously occupied by the displacing unit.\n\nSince Fleet Sevastopol has nowhere to retreat, it disbands automatically.\n\n\n--Italy--\n\nArmy Apulia to Trieste\nFleet Adriatic Sea convoys Army Apulia to Trieste\nArmy Venezia supports Army Apulia to Trieste\nFleet Albania supports Army Apulia to Trieste\n\nThere are two units supporting Army Apulia into Trieste, but since Fleet Trieste is supported by two units (see Austria-Hungary, above), the attack bounces.\n\nFinally note that the orders for both the army being convoyed and the fleet doing the convoying must use the proper protocol and fully identify the units involved in the convoy. This is a complex manoeuver and becomes more complex if it involves units controlled by more than one power.\n\n3. Hold\nThis is the default for all units (what they will do if not given any other orders). The unit will stay in its position, and will not move, support, convoy, or do anything. Holding units can be supported by units in neighboring provinces or be attacked by foreign units. If the attacking unit has more units supporting it than the holding unit, the holding unit is ousted from that province and must either retreat or disband. The format is:\n\nA [province] H (Army garrison)\nF [province] H (Fleet garrison)\nFor example:\n\nA BER H means the Army garrison in Berlin.\n\n4. Convoy (Occupation)\n\nThis move is used to transfer army units across sea spaces, or to move large distances in one move. Only armies may be convoyed, and only fleets may convoy.\n\nThe fleet may choose to transport an army from one coastal province to another. The operation requires the collaboration of multiple fleets, especially over long distances. The format is:\n\nF [province] C A [origin province] - [destination province]\nFor example:\n\nF ENG C A LON-BRE refers to the fleet in the English Channel transporting the Army of London to Brest (BRE).\n\nA convoy order would be:\n\n--England--\nA YOR - NOR\nFleet North Sea convoys Army Yorkshire to Norway\n\nArmy Yorkshire will move to Norway, unless another unit should prevent this process by dislodging or destroying the convoying fleet. If a convoy order fails and the convoyed piece could not ordinarily move there without the convoy, the convoyed army unit holds.\n\nThe unit being convoyed can be supported into its destination space by any other units that border the destination space, just like any other support. However, if the convoying fleet is dislodged, it cannot convoy the unit and the entire move will fail. Note that convoys are not \"broken\" as easily as support; a convoying fleet that is attacked but not dislodged will successfully carry out its convoy order.\n\nConvoying fleets can be supported to prevent them from being dislodged or destroyed. Convoying fleets cannot perform any other order.\n\nA fleet on a coastal space may not convoy.\n\nIf an army can arrive to its destination either by land or convoy, convoy is used if at least one of the convoying fleets belongs to the army's owner, or if army's owner specified \"via convoy\" on the army's move order; otherwise, land route is used.\n\nIf several fleets are convoying an army so that it can take multiple routes to its destination, convoy succeeds as long as at least one convoy route remains open.\n\n5. Build\nDuring the specified construction phase of the game, the country in control can choose to build new units (army or fleet) in the supply center, provided that there are supply centers available and it does not exceed its maximum number of supply centers.\n\nFor example:\n\nBuild A BER means to build a new army in Berlin.\n\n6. Disband\nUnits may choose to disband, usually when defeated or strategically necessary.\n\nSyntax:\n\n// Comments\n// -----------------------------\n// Order Syntax\n// -----------------------------\n// *** Recommended syntax **\nA LON H\nF IRI - MAO\nA IRI - MAO VIA\nA WAL S F LON\nA WAL S F MAO - IRI\nF NWG C A NWY - EDI\nA IRO R MAO\nA IRO D\nA LON B\nF LIV B\n\n// Support\nA WAL S F LON\nWAL S LON\nA WAL S LON\nF WAL S F MAO - IRI\n\n// Convoy\nF NWG C A NWY - EDI\nNWG C NWY - EDI\n\n// Retreat (Retreat Phase)\nA IRO R MAO\nRETREAT IRO - MAO\nA IRO D\nRETREAT IRO DISBAND\n\n// Build\nA LON B\nF LIV B\nBUILD A LON\nBUILD F LIV\n\n// Remove\nF LIV D\nREMOVE F LIV\nDISBAND F LIV\n\n// Waive\nWAIVE\n\nThe range of action space per turn\nAt each turn, players can choose a combination of actions to perform on the units they control, which can be moves, supports, garrisons, capture, etc.\n                                  \nEnd-of-year and supply centers\nAfter each Fall move, newly acquired supply centers become owned by the occupying player, and each power's supply center total is recalculated; players with fewer supply centers than units on the board must disband units, while players with more supply centers than units on the board are entitled to build units in their open (unoccupied) Home centers (supply centers controlled at the start of the game). Players who have lost all of their Home centers may not build new units, while players controlling no supply centers are eliminated from the game. If a player controls 18 or more (being more than half) of the 34 supply centers at the end of a year, they are the winner. Players who remain may also agree to a draw \u2013 around half of all games will end in a draw.\n\nYou are playing as []. The other players are playing as the following powers: AUSTRIA, ENGLAND, FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, RUSSIA, TURKEY. There are no neutral powers in this game. The action space is the set of possible orders that you can issue to your units. You can issue orders to move your units to different locations, support other players' units, hold your units in place, or convoy your units across sea zones.\n"

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"step_by_step_reasoning\": \"Your step by step reasoning here\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **step_by_step_reasoning:**\n     - Provide your above step by step reasoning details in the \"step_by_step_reasoning\" field.\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"step_by_step_reasoning\": \"Your step by step reasoning here\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **step_by_step_reasoning:**\n     - Provide your above step by step reasoning details in the \"step_by_step_reasoning\" field.\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Moving to GRE could be advantageous.\n     - **A SER:** Can support moves or movements to adjacent territories like BUL or GRE. An aggressive move to BUL can challenge Turkey's southern position.\n     - **A VIE:** Could support or attack nearby regions, but holding or moving to prepare for future aggression or defense could be wise.\n\n   - **England:**\n     - **F ENG:** Could assert control over the Channel or assist in an attack. Supporting a landing in BEL or solidifying the sea positions can be strategic.\n     - **F NTH:** Could support moves into BEL or NWY, offering options for continental influence.\n     - **A YOR:** Could move to LON for defense or attempt a move via convoy to continental Europe.\n\n   Let's decide on the most logical actions for our units:\n\n### Strategic Decisions\n\n- **Austria:**\n  - **F ALB - GRE:** Move the fleet from Albania to Greece to secure a potential supply center.\n  - **A SER - BUL:** Move to Bulgaria to challenge Turkey for control.\n  - **A VIE S A SER - BUL:** Support the move from Serbia to Bulgaria to ensure its success.\n\n- **England:**\n  - **F ENG - BEL:** Move the fleet to support an army into Belgium.\n  - **F NTH - NWY:** Move to Norway to expand England's influence.\n  - **A YOR - LON:** Secure London to maintain strategic defense and prepare for future naval moves.\n\n### Verification and Revision\n\n- Checked the adjacency rules to ensure all moves are valid and supportive moves are within range.\n- Ensured attack targets are not currently controlled.\n- Verified that all orders align with the goal of securing more supply centers.\n\n### JSON Object\n\n```json\n{\n  \"phase\": \"F1901M\",\n  \"step_by_step_reasoning\": \"Analyzed Austria's position for Balkan dominance and England's naval expansion.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

(Please refer to the game state)\n     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.\n     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`\n\n   - **attackable:**\n     - A list of locations.\n     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.\n     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack.

Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Recap Negotiation Phase\n\nIn the negotiation phase, there might have been promises or threats that could influence current actions. Given no notes are provided, we will assume we need to focus on strategically important moves rather than relying on alliances or conflicts known from the negotiation phase.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Current State\n\n#### Austria\n- **Units**: A BUD, F EAS, A ALB\n- **Supply Centers**: BUD, VIE, GRE\n- **Influence**: BUD, VIE, AEG, EAS, ALB\n\n#### England\n- **Units**: F IRI, F STP/NC, F ENG, A WAL\n- **Supply Centers**: EDI, LON, LVP, STP\n- **Influence**: EDI, LVP, LON, MAO, IRI, STP, YOR, ENG, WAL\n\n#### Other Powers\n- Notably, Germany has strong positioning with units in NTH, RUH, PIC, SKA, MAR, and HEL, indicating a strong central position in Europe.\n- Turkey controls SEV and has influence in surrounding areas.\n\n### 2. Supply Center Strategy\n\nGiven our current control:\n- **Austria**: Focus on securing Serbia and protecting against potential advances from Turkey or Russia.\n- **England**: Consolidate position in the North Sea and support moves in strategic locations like Belgium or Holland.\n\n### 3. Analyze Possible Orders for Units\n\nFor each unit, consider moves that could gain control of supply centers or improve strategic positioning.\n\n#### Austria\n\n- **A ALB**: Potential to attack into Greece or provide support.\n- **A BUD**: Possible to move to RUM or support moves to prevent advancement by Turkey or Russia.\n- **F EAS**: Can support naval operations around ION and AEG.\n\n#### England\n\n- **F ENG**: Can move to MAO, support land advances, or protect sea routes.\n- **F IRI**: Support for naval dominance in MAO or support WAL.\n- **F STP/NC**: Protect against or push into Norwegian holdings.\n- **A WAL**: Potential to move to LON or reinforce English land positions.\n\n### 4. Order Decision\n\nPrioritize gaining and securing supply centers, preparing for future offensive, and ensuring the defense of currently held territories.\n\n### 5. Verification of Orders\n\nCheck if orders align with strategic objectives and game rules.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nHere's the final decision in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"F1903M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Austria should consolidate support in the Balkans to secure GRE and BUD.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

SMY moves to EAS to potentially be useful in broader Mediterranean operations or future movements.\n  \n- **England's Strategy:** NWY is moved against STP/NC to pressure Russia and potentially gain a new center. LVP is convoyed to BRE, leveraging ENG's position in the channel to support the convoy, thus aiming to expand into French territories.\n\nThis plan aims to strengthen positions and prepare for further expansions in strategic locations."

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'AUSTRIA': {'AEG': ['F AEG S F CON', 'F AEG - GRE', 'F AEG C A BUL - GRE', 'F AEG S A BUL - CON', 'F AEG S F CON - BUL/SC', 'F AEG C A BUL - NAP', 'F AEG C A BUL - CON', 'F AEG S F CON - SMY', 'F AEG S A ARM - SMY', 'F AEG S A TUS - GRE', 'F AEG C A BUL - ALB', 'F AEG C A GRE - BUL', 'F AEG C A TUS - CON', 'F AEG - SMY', 'F AEG S A ARM - CON', 'F AEG S A GRE', 'F AEG C A GRE - CON', 'F AEG C A BUL - TUN', 'F AEG S A RUM - BUL', 'F AEG C A TUS - SMY', 'F AEG C A BUL - ROM', 'F AEG - ION', 'F AEG C A ALB - SMY', 'F AEG S F BLA - CON', 'F AEG S F CON - BUL', 'F AEG S A SER - BUL', 'F AEG S A SER - GRE', 'F AEG S F BLA - BUL', 'F AEG C A ALB - CON', 'F AEG - BUL/SC', 'F AEG H', 'F AEG S A BUL - GRE', 'F AEG S A ARM - BUL', 'F AEG - EAS', 'F AEG S F ION - EAS', 'F AEG S F TYS - ION', 'F AEG C A ALB - BUL', 'F AEG S F BLA - BUL/EC', 'F AEG C A TUS - BUL', 'F AEG S A RUM - CON', 'F AEG - CON', 'F AEG C A BUL - TUS', 'F AEG S A BUL', 'F AEG S F ION - GRE', 'F AEG C A BUL - SMY', 'F AEG C A GRE - SMY', 'F AEG S A GRE - BUL', 'F AEG S F CON - BUL/EC', 'F AEG C A BUL - APU', 'F AEG S F ION', 'F AEG S A ALB - GRE'], 'ALB': ['A ALB - NAP VIA', 'A ALB S A GRE', 'A ALB - ROM VIA', 'A ALB S A SER - GRE', 'A ALB S A TRI - SER', 'A ALB S A TUS - GRE', 'A ALB S A RUM - SER', 'A ALB - GRE VIA', 'A ALB - GRE', 'A ALB - TUS VIA', 'A ALB - CON VIA', 'A ALB - SMY VIA', 'A ALB - APU VIA', 'A ALB S A SER - TRI', 'A ALB - BUL VIA', 'A ALB S A TRI', 'A ALB - SER', 'A ALB S A GRE - SER', 'A ALB S F ION - GRE', 'A ALB H', 'A ALB S A SER', 'A ALB S A BUL - SER', 'A ALB - TRI', 'A ALB S F AEG - GRE', 'A ALB S A BUL - GRE', 'A ALB S A BUD - SER', 'A ALB S A BUD - TRI', 'A ALB - TUN VIA'], 'BUD': ['A BUD H', 'A BUD S A ALB - SER', 'A BUD S A UKR - RUM', 'A BUD S F BLA - RUM', 'A BUD S A TRI', 'A BUD S A TRI - VIE', 'A BUD S A RUM - GAL', 'A BUD S F SEV - RUM', 'A BUD S A ARM - RUM', 'A BUD S A TRI - SER', 'A BUD S A GRE - SER', 'A BUD - RUM', 'A BUD S A ALB - TRI', 'A BUD S A RUM', 'A BUD S A SER - TRI', 'A BUD - GAL', 'A BUD S A BUL - RUM', 'A BUD - TRI', 'A BUD S A UKR - GAL', 'A BUD S A SER', 'A BUD - SER', 'A BUD S A RUM - SER', 'A BUD - VIE', 'A BUD S A SER - RUM', 'A BUD S A BUL - SER']}, 'ENGLAND': {'BRE': ['F BRE S F PIC', 'F BRE S A PAR - PIC', 'F BRE - GAS', 'F BRE S A GAS', 'F BRE H', 'F BRE S F IRI - MAO', 'F BRE S A PAR - GAS', 'F BRE - MAO', 'F BRE - ENG', 'F BRE S A BUR - GAS', 'F BRE S F IRI - ENG', 'F BRE S A MAR - GAS', 'F BRE S F PIC - ENG', 'F BRE S A BUR - PIC', 'F BRE - PIC'], 'IRI': ['F IRI - MAO', 'F IRI S F BRE - MAO', 'F IRI - ENG', 'F IRI S F LVP - WAL', 'F IRI H', 'F IRI S F LVP', 'F IRI S A LON - WAL', 'F IRI S F BRE - ENG', 'F IRI - NAO', 'F IRI - WAL', 'F IRI S F PIC - ENG', 'F IRI S F LVP - NAO', 'F IRI - LVP'], 'LON': ['A LON - WAL', 'A LON S F IRI - WAL', 'A LON H', 'A LON S F LVP - WAL', 'A LON - YOR']}}\n</possible_orders>\n\n### **Your Objective:**\n\nYour ultimate goal is absolute domination\u2014seize every supply center and crush your opposition to win!

Analyze Current State\n\n- **Austria:**\n  - Units: A BUD, A ALB, F AEG\n  - Supply Centers: 3 (BUD, VIE, SMY)\n- **England:**\n  - Units: F IRI, F BRE, A LON\n  - Supply Centers: 3 (LON, LVP, STP)\n\n- **Strategic Location Analysis:**\n  - Austria is positioned to influence the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean.\n  - England controls important coastal positions and has a foothold in Brest, which provides leverage against France.\n\n### 2. Plan to Expand Control of Supply Centers\n\n- Austria could push into Italy or consolidate control in the Balkans.\n- England might want to press into France further or protect its positions in England.\n\n### 3. Analyze Possible Orders\n\n#### Austria\n- **F AEG:**\n  - Potential actions: Support moves/holds, convoy, or relocate to SMY or ION.\n  - Strategic choice: Use AEG to support an aggressive push into Greece or act defensively. Move to SMY could deny enemy leverage there.\n\n- **A ALB:**\n  - Potential actions: Move to support Greece or Serbia or shift to Trieste or Greece.\n  - Strategic choice: ALB can support a move to Greece or bolster defense in the Balkans.\n\n- **A BUD:**\n  - Potential actions: Support a move or consolidation in the Balkans.\n  - Strategic choice: Secure the Balkans by shifting to RUM or supporting adjacent units.\n\n#### England\n- **F IRI:**\n  - Potential actions: Relocate to MAO or engage in the protection of English waters.\n  - Strategic choice: Shift to MAO to enhance naval influence or secure the British Isles.\n\n- **F BRE:**\n  - Potential actions: Support actions against France or reposition.\n  - Strategic choice: Support a move against GAS or MAO to maintain pressure on France.\n\n- **A LON:**\n  - Potential actions: Move to expand influence in WAL or fortify England.\n  - Strategic choice: Shift to WAL to expand control within the British Isles or support defensive actions.\n\n### 4. Make Order Decisions\n\n- **Austria:**\n  - AEG can move to ION, enhancing influence in the sea. ALB should secure GRE if feasible. BUD should aim to control SER.\n\n- **England:**\n  - IRI to MAO to control maritime routes. BRE could either support or relocate to GAS for a potential advance.\n\n### 5. Revise and Verify Orders\n\n- We need to ensure compliance with adjacent region rules and check for necessary support in any intended moves.\n\n### Finalizing Orders\nNow, formulating the JSON output according to the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"F1906M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Austria is strengthening its hold in the Balkans and pushing into the eastern Mediterranean. England is applying pressure on France and securing maritime dominance.\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"BUD\", \"ALB\", \"AEG\", \"LON\", \"IRI\", \"BRE\"],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BUD\", \"ALB\", \"AEG\", \"LON\", \"IRI\", \"BRE\"],\n    \"adjacent\": [\n        {\"AEG\": [\"BUL/SC\", \"CON\", \"EAS\", \"GRE\", \"ION\", \"SMY\"]},\n        {\"ALB\": [\"ADR\", \"GRE\", \"ION\", \"SER\", \"TRI\"]},\n        {\"BUD\": [\"GAL\", \"RUM\", \"SER\", \"TRI\", \"VIE\"]},\n        {\"BRE\": [\"ENG\", \"GAS\", \"MAO\", \"PAR\", \"PIC\"]},\n        {\"IRI\": [\"ENG\", \"LVP\", \"MAO\", \"NAO\", \"WAL\"]},\n        {\"LON\": [\"ENG\", \"NTH\", \"YOR\", \"WAL\"]}\n    ],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", \"KIE\", \"NWY\", \"PAR\", \"TUS\", \"SWE\", \"RUH\", \"GRE\", \"SER\", \"TRI\", \"RUM\", \"UKR\", \"SEV\", \"SKA\", \"CON\", \"BLA\", \"ARM\"],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    \"attackable\": [\"GRE\", \"SER\", \"MAO\", \"GAS\"],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"GRE\": 2}, {\"SER\": 1}, {\"MAO\": 1}, {\"GAS\": 1}],\n    \"support_given\": [],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"AUSTRIA\": [0, 1, 1],\n        \"ENGLAND\": [1, 0, 0]\n    },\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"AUSTRIA\": [\"F AEG - ION\", \"A ALB - GRE\", \"A BUD - SER\"],\n        \"ENGLAND\": [\"F IRI - MAO\", \"F BRE - GAS\", \"A LON - WAL\"]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis strategic set of orders focuses on expanding Austria\u2019s influence in the Balkans while England pressures France and secures its maritime presence. Let me know if you need any adjustments or further considerations."

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Consider coordination against Italy or Turkey if advantageous.\n   - For England: Focus on securing Iberian Peninsula (POR) or Northern territories like HOL or BEL.\n\n3. **Possible Orders Analysis:**\n   - **Austria:**\n     - A BUD: Could support A ALB to GRE or attack neighboring regions like RUM or SER.\n     - A ALB: Potential to support or move to GRE, SMY, or SER. Consider preparing for future moves against Italy.\n     - F GRE: Could hold or support movements into the ION or AEG.\n\n   - **England:**\n     - A YOR: Potential to secure LON, EDI, or move towards LVP for strategic positioning.\n     - F SPA/SC: Could move to POR or support actions in the WES.\n\n4. **Plan and Verify Orders:**\n   - **Austria:**\n     - A ALB - GRE: Move to secure GRE and prepare for potential further actions.\n     - A BUD S A ALB - GRE: Provide support to ensure a secure move to GRE.\n     - F GRE - ION: Move to ION to expand influence in the Mediterranean.\n\n   - **England:**\n     - A YOR - LVP: Move towards securing LVP.\n     - F SPA/SC - POR: Move to secure POR, completing control over Iberia.\n\n5. **Validation:**\n   - Ensure none of the moves target already controlled regions.\n   - Confirm that the required support is in place for each move.\n   - Moves comply with adjacency and game rules.\n\nBased on the analysis, here's the JSON object with proposed orders:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"F1907M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Austria aims to strengthen its position in the Balkans by securing Greece and building a presence in the Mediterranean.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'AUSTRIA': {'BUD': ['A BUD H', 'A BUD S A VIE -

Strategic Goals:\n- **Austria:**\n  - Immediate threats may come from neighboring Italy and Russia.\n  - Expansion opportunities: SER, which is adjacent and controlled by Italy.\n\n- **England:**\n  - Maintain control over the English Channel and MAO for sea supremacy.\n  - Expansion opportunities: BEL or BRE from Germany's control.\n\n#### 3. Possible Orders Analysis:\n- **Austria:**\n  - **A BUD**: Can move to RUM or support other adjacent regions.\n  - **A GRE**: Can move to SER or hold.\n  - **F ION**: Has numerous convoy options and can support adjacent regions.\n  - **A VIE**: Can move to TRI or support adjacent regions.\n\n- **England:**\n  - **F ENG**: Can move to LON or support operations in the North Sea.\n  - **F MAO**: Can move to adjacent sea zones or support operations.\n  - **A WAL**: Can move to adjacent regions or support actions in LON.\n\n### Orders and Strategy:\n\nBased on this analysis, we can draft a potential strategy for both Austria and England:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"phase\": \"F1908M\",\n  \"reason\": \"Strategic expansion into vulnerable regions and maintaining control over key territories.\",\n  \"my_location\": [\"BUD\", \"GRE\", \"VIE\", \"ION\", \"WAL\", \"MAO\", \"ENG\"],\n  \"my_unit\": [\"A BUD\", \"A GRE\", \"A VIE\", \"F ION\", \"A WAL\", \"F MAO\", \"F ENG\"],\n  \"adjacent\": [\n    {\"BUD\": [\"GAL\", \"RUM\", \"SER\", \"TRI\", \"VIE\"]},\n    {\"GRE\": [\"AEG\", \"ALB\", \"BUL/SC\", \"ION\", \"SER\"]},\n    {\"VIE\": [\"BOH\", \"BUD\", \"GAL\", \"TRI\", \"TYR\"]},\n    {\"ION\": [\"ADR\", \"AEG\", \"ALB\", \"APU\", \"EAS\", \"GRE\", \"NAP\", \"TUN\", \"TYS\"]},\n    {\"ENG\": [\"BEL\", \"BRE\", \"IRI\", \"LON\", \"MAO\", \"NTH\", \"PIC\", \"WAL\"]},\n    {\"MAO\": [\"BRE\", \"ENG\", \"GAS\", \"IRI\", \"NAF\", \"NAO\", \"POR\", \"SPA/NC\", \"SPA/SC\", \"WES\"]},\n    {\"WAL\": [\"ENG\", \"IRI\", \"LON\", \"LVP\", \"yor\"]}\n  ],\n  \"other_power_location\": [\"SER\", \"BEL\", \"BRE\", \"RUM\", \"TRI\"],\n  \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  \"attackable\": [\"SER\", \"BEL\", \"BRE\", \"RUM\"],\n  \"attack_analysis\": [{\"SER\": 1}, {\"BEL\": 1}, {\"BRE\": 1}, {\"RUM\": 1}],\n  \"support_given\": [\n    {\"supporter\": \"ENG\", \"supported\": \"WAL\", \"target\": \"BRE\"},\n    {\"supporter\": \"ION\", \"supported\": \"GRE\", \"target\": \"SER\"}\n  ],\n  \"attack_mask\": {\n    \"AUSTRIA\": [1, 0, 0, 0],\n    \"ENGLAND\": [0, 1, 1]\n  },\n  \"orders\": {\n    \"AUSTRIA\": [\"A BUD - RUM\", \"A GRE - SER\", \"A VIE S A GRE - SER\", \"F ION S A GRE - SER\"],\n    \"ENGLAND\": [\"F ENG S A WAL - BRE\", \"F MAO - WES\", \"A WAL - BRE\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Austria**: Attempt to take control of RUM and SER, weakening Russian and Italian positions.\n- **England**: Focus on reinforcing positions around the Channel and expanding into BRE, a key supply center currently under German control.\n\n### Verification:\n- All moves respect adjacency rules.\n- Planned attacks target external powers' regions.\n- Support is allocated to ensure successful attacks on contested regions. \n\nIf you have further modifications or need more calculations, let me know!"

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here.

(based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'AUSTRIA': {'GRE': ['A GRE -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

          "content": "\nYou are playing a game of Diplomacy against 6 opponents. Diplomacy is a 7-player turn based game, where players must use negotiation and strategy to control the most supply centers on the map. The players can move their units to different locations on the map, and can support other players' units to help them succeed. The game is played on a map of Europe, divided into territories and sea zones. The players can issue orders to their units to move, support, hold, or convoy. The game ends when one player controls 18 supply centers.\n\n34 of the land provinces are supply centers. Possession of these supply centers allows the powers who control them to raise and maintain armies and fleets. As they are also a central part of the game's victory conditions, they are the focus of much of the game's activity.\n\nEach player is given three (save for Russia, which has four) home supply centers. These spaces are the starting point for their owning power's initial forces. The players can then build new units at these home supply centers as they capture further supply centers. New units can only be built on a power's home supply centers. If a power loses all of its home supply centers it may continue to play; however, it may not build new units until it has recaptured at least one of its home supply centers.\n\nIn Diplomacy, there are two types of units: Armies and Fleets. An army can travel in land spaces and coastal land spaces, and a fleet can travel in sea spaces and coastal land spaces.\n\nAll units in Diplomacy move only one space at a time and only one unit may occupy any space at any time. The exception to this rule comes in the form of a successful convoy, where a convoyed army may travel multiple spaces depending on the length of the chain created by the convoying fleets. A convoyed army must embark from a coastal land province and land at a coastal land province.\n\nDiplomacy proceeds by seasons, beginning in the year 1901, with each year divided into two main seasons: the \"Spring\" and \"Fall\" (Autumn) moves. Each season is further divided into negotiation and movement phases, followed by \"retreat\" or \"disband\" adjustments and an end-of-the-year Winter phase of new builds or removals following the Fall adjustments.\n                                  \nNegotiation phase\n\nIn the negotiation phase, players discuss tactics and strategy, form alliances, and share intelligence or spread disinformation. Negotiations may be made public or kept private. Players are not bound to anything they say or promise, and no agreements are enforceable.\nCommunication and trust are highly important; players must forge alliances with others and observe their actions to evaluate their trustworthiness. At the same time, they must convince others of their own trustworthiness while making plans to turn against their allies when least expected. A well-timed betrayal can be just as profitable as an enduring, reliable alliance.\n\nMovement phase\n\nAfter the negotiation period, players write secret orders for each unit; these orders are revealed and executed simultaneously. A unit can move from its location to an adjacent space, support an adjacent unit to hold an area in the event of an attack, support another unit to attack a space into which it could move itself, or hold defensively. In addition, fleets may transport armies from one coast space to another when in a chain called a \"convoy\". Armies may only occupy land regions, and fleets occupy sea regions and the land regions that border named seas. Only one unit may occupy each region. If multiple units are ordered to move to the same region, only the unit with the most support moves there. If two or more units have the same highest support, a standoff occurs and no units ordered to that region move. A unit ordered to give support that is attacked has those orders canceled and is forced to hold, except in the case that support is being given to a unit invading the region from which the attack originated (in which case the unit that had been ordered to give support must retreat from, rather than hold, its position).\nCertain spaces on the board have two coasts and here a player must specify which one they want their fleet to occupy. A fleet can only move to coasts and oceans that border the coast that it is on. For example, a fleet occupying the southern coast of Bulgaria cannot move into Romania or the Black Sea, but a fleet on the east coast could.\n\nIn the game of Diplomacy, an action space is the collection of all the legal actions that each country or unit can take in each round. The following are common types of actions in games and their common formats:\n\n1. Attack/Move\n\nThis order moves the unit in one province to an adjacent province. Of course, armies cannot move into sea provinces, and fleets cannot move into landlocked provinces.\n\nA unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere.\n\nTwo units may not swap provinces, unless there is a convoy involved. \n\nThe format is:\n\nA [province] - [target province] (Army moves from current position to target province)\nF [province] - [target province] (Fleet moves from current position to target province)\nFor example:\n\nA BER - MUN indicates that the army from Berlin moved to Munich.\nF NTH - ENG indicates the movement of the fleet from the North Sea (NTH) to the English Channel (ENG).\n\nWhen the destination province is occupied by another unit, they do not move, unless either are attacked or defended by stronger support. When two units with equal support try to move into the same destination province, for instance:\n\nGermany\nA MUN - TYR\n\nItaly\nA VEN - TYR\n\nNeither of the two units can go into Tyrolia. Army Venice will stay in Venice, and Army Munich will stay in Munich. Again, this is assuming that these two units are the only two units in this little battle, and that they have equal support for their moves.\n\n2. Support\n\nSupport is the trickiest aspect of the rules, and the most important of the game. Support may involve cooperation between two (or more) powers, and is the only way to make forward progress through enemy territory (unless you can convince the enemy to let you in). Simply put, more support defeats less support.\n\nThe support order is given in reference to another unit's move. That other unit's move must be to a province into which the supporting unit could otherwise move. Support may also be given to a unit holding its position. In addition, units giving support can themselves be supported in their holding position.\n\nSupport is a unit's sole action for a given move, and supporting units remain where they are (unless they are attacked by greater support and have to retreat or disband during the retreat phase).\n\nA country cannot dislodge or support the dislodgement of one of its own units, although if same country's units attempt to move into the same province with equal support, neither will succeed as normal.\n\nCutting Support: If the supporting unit is attacked during the turn by some other unit, its support is cut. In effect, the support order becomes a hold order, as the unit must defend its province against the attack. Note that a unit occupying the province into which the support is directed cannot cut support, unless its attack successfully dislodges the supporting unit. An attack by a country on one of its own units also doesn't cut support.\n\nThe format is:\n\nA [province] S A [target province] - [destination] (support army movement)\nA [province] S A [target province] (supporting the garrisoning of the army)\nF [province] S F [target province] - [destination] (Support fleet movement)\nF [province] S F [target province] (garrisoning of supporting fleet)\nFor example:\n\nA BER S A MUN indicated that the Army in Berlin supported the Army garrison in Munich.\nA BER S A MUN-KIE stated that the Army of Berlin supported the Army of Munich in moving to Kiel.\n\nOther example:\n\nNB: Below are complete orders as submitted by all 7 Powers for the Fall 1907 campaign season of a made-up game to help you understand the intricacies of supporting and breaking support. Having a game map to look on with is highly recommended; the one provided at the top of this page is adequate.\n\n\nWe'll start with:\n\n--Germany--\nArmy Ruhr to Holland\nFleet Kiel supports Army Ruhr to Holland\nArmy Munich supports Army Ruhr to Holland\nNote that in this case the order for Munich to support Ruhr into Holland would not work because Munich does not border Holland and thus cannot support Ruhr in (Munich could, however, support Ruhr if Ruhr were simply holding). The rule for supporting an attack is that a supporting unit must border the province being attacked, but need not border the attacker's province of origin (to support a unit to hold, however, the supporting unit must border the supported unit). Essentially, the supporting unit must border the destination of the supported unit, whether it is its own province or a new province entirely. In sum, Ruhr is actually attacking Holland with the support of only one unit (Fleet Kiel).\n\nArmy Prussia supports Army Silesia\nArmy Silesia supports Army Prussia\nHere, Army Prussia is supported by one unit, and Army Silesia is supported by one unit. The last two moves are legal, and this method of double-support is helpful when there are two units that both could be attacked and dislodged. Of course, if both units are attacked, the support fails.\n\n\n--England--\nArmy London to Holland\nFleet North Sea convoys Army London to Holland (<-- a convoy)\nFleet Heligoland Bight supports Army London to Holland\nNote that the convoying fleet is not considered to be giving support, so Army London actually has support from only one unit: Fleet Heligoland-Bight.\n\nArmy Denmark to Kiel\nHere England interferes with Germany's plans (see Germany, above) by attacking Kiel with Army Denmark. This cuts the support of Fleet Kiel to Army Ruhr, thereby leaving Army Ruhr's attack on Holland unsupported.\n\nArmy London, on the other hand, (see above) is supported in its attack on Holland by one unit (Fleet Heligoland-Bight), thereby enabling Army London to be convoyed successfully into Holland, as long as Fleet North Sea is not dislodged during the convoy.\n\nArmy Picardy to Brest\nFleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean supports Army Picardy to Brest\nFleet English Channel supports Army Picardy to Brest\nHere Army Picardy is supported by both Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean and Fleet English Channel to move into Brest. Unless the French successfully defend it, England will also take Brest.\n\n\n--France--\n\nFleet Gascony to Mid-Atlantic Ocean\nFleet Irish Sea to English Channel\nFleet Gascony and Fleet Irish Sea cut the support by Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean and Fleet English Channel for England's Army Picardy (see England, above). Therefore, Army Picardy is now attacking Brest unsupported.\n\nFleet Brest holds\nArmy Paris supports Fleet Brest\nArmy Paris supports Fleet Brest, and so Army Picardy\u2019s now unsupported attempt to move into Brest fails.\n\nArmy Burgundy to Ruhr\nArmy Burgundy does not successfully move into Ruhr because Army Ruhr\u2019s move to Holland failed (see Germany and England, above).\n\n\n--Russia--\n\nFleet Sevastopol holds\nArmy Moscow supports Fleet Sevastopol\n\nFleet Sevastopol is supported by Army Moscow.\n\nFleet St. Petersburg (North Coast) to Norway\nArmy Finland supports Fleet St. Petersburg (North Coast) to Norway\n\nNorway is not occupied, so Russia takes it immediately.\n\nArmy Livonia to Prussia\n\nUnsupported Army Livonia attempts to move into Prussia, but since Army Prussia is supported by Army Silesia (see Germany, above), the attack is not successful.\n\n\n--Austria-Hungary--\n\nArmy Ukraine supports Fleet Sevastopol\n\nArmy Ukraine supports Fleet Sevastopol, so there are now two units supporting (see Russia, above). In fact, international support is necessary in alliances, whether supporting each other in defence or to attack another Power.\n\nFleet Trieste holds\nArmy Budapest supports Fleet Trieste\nArmy Vienna supports Fleet Trieste\n\nThere are two units supporting Fleet Trieste: Army Budapest and Army Vienna.\n\n\n--Turkey--\n\nArmy Galicia to Ukraine\n\nArmy Galicia cuts the Austrian support to Sevastopol, thereby decreasing the support to Sevastopol by one unit (see Austria and Russia, above).\n\nFleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\nArmy Armenia supports Fleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\nArmy Rumania supports Fleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\n\nNow, since Fleet Black Sea is supported by two units into Sevastopol, Fleet Black Sea moves into Sevastopol, and Fleet Sevastopol has to be disbanded or retreat. A retreating fleet that is displaced by another force can only retreat into a movable space (i.e. a sea or coastal province that is vacant) which may not be the same space that was previously occupied by the displacing unit.\n\nSince Fleet Sevastopol has nowhere to retreat, it disbands automatically.\n\n\n--Italy--\n\nArmy Apulia to Trieste\nFleet Adriatic Sea convoys Army Apulia to Trieste\nArmy Venezia supports Army Apulia to Trieste\nFleet Albania supports Army Apulia to Trieste\n\nThere are two units supporting Army Apulia into Trieste, but since Fleet Trieste is supported by two units (see Austria-Hungary, above), the attack bounces.\n\nFinally note that the orders for both the army being convoyed and the fleet doing the convoying must use the proper protocol and fully identify the units involved in the convoy. This is a complex manoeuver and becomes more complex if it involves units controlled by more than one power.\n\n3. Hold\nThis is the default for all units (what they will do if not given any other orders). The unit will stay in its position, and will not move, support, convoy, or do anything. Holding units can be supported by units in neighboring provinces or be attacked by foreign units. If the attacking unit has more units supporting it than the holding unit, the holding unit is ousted from that province and must either retreat or disband. The format is:\n\nA [province] H (Army garrison)\nF [province] H (Fleet garrison)\nFor example:\n\nA BER H means the Army garrison in Berlin.\n\n4. Convoy (Occupation)\n\nThis move is used to transfer army units across sea spaces, or to move large distances in one move. Only armies may be convoyed, and only fleets may convoy.\n\nThe fleet may choose to transport an army from one coastal province to another. The operation requires the collaboration of multiple fleets, especially over long distances. The format is:\n\nF [province] C A [origin province] - [destination province]\nFor example:\n\nF ENG C A LON-BRE refers to the fleet in the English Channel transporting the Army of London to Brest (BRE).\n\nA convoy order would be:\n\n--England--\nA YOR - NOR\nFleet North Sea convoys Army Yorkshire to Norway\n\nArmy Yorkshire will move to Norway, unless another unit should prevent this process by dislodging or destroying the convoying fleet. If a convoy order fails and the convoyed piece could not ordinarily move there without the convoy, the convoyed army unit holds.\n\nThe unit being convoyed can be supported into its destination space by any other units that border the destination space, just like any other support. However, if the convoying fleet is dislodged, it cannot convoy the unit and the entire move will fail. Note that convoys are not \"broken\" as easily as support; a convoying fleet that is attacked but not dislodged will successfully carry out its convoy order.\n\nConvoying fleets can be supported to prevent them from being dislodged or destroyed. Convoying fleets cannot perform any other order.\n\nA fleet on a coastal space may not convoy.\n\nIf an army can arrive to its destination either by land or convoy, convoy is used if at least one of the convoying fleets belongs to the army's owner, or if army's owner specified \"via convoy\" on the army's move order; otherwise, land route is used.\n\nIf several fleets are convoying an army so that it can take multiple routes to its destination, convoy succeeds as long as at least one convoy route remains open.\n\n5. Build\nDuring the specified construction phase of the game, the country in control can choose to build new units (army or fleet) in the supply center, provided that there are supply centers available and it does not exceed its maximum number of supply centers.\n\nFor example:\n\nBuild A BER means to build a new army in Berlin.\n\n6. Disband\nUnits may choose to disband, usually when defeated or strategically necessary.\n\nSyntax:\n\n// Comments\n// -----------------------------\n// Order Syntax\n// -----------------------------\n// *** Recommended syntax **\nA LON H\nF IRI - MAO\nA IRI - MAO VIA\nA WAL S F LON\nA WAL S F MAO - IRI\nF NWG C A NWY - EDI\nA IRO R MAO\nA IRO D\nA LON B\nF LIV B\n\n// Support\nA WAL S F LON\nWAL S LON\nA WAL S LON\nF WAL S F MAO - IRI\n\n// Convoy\nF NWG C A NWY - EDI\nNWG C NWY - EDI\n\n// Retreat (Retreat Phase)\nA IRO R MAO\nRETREAT IRO - MAO\nA IRO D\nRETREAT IRO DISBAND\n\n// Build\nA LON B\nF LIV B\nBUILD A LON\nBUILD F LIV\n\n// Remove\nF LIV D\nREMOVE F LIV\nDISBAND F LIV\n\n// Waive\nWAIVE\n\nThe range of action space per turn\nAt each turn, players can choose a combination of actions to perform on the units they control, which can be moves, supports, garrisons, capture, etc.\n                                  \nEnd-of-year and supply centers\nAfter each Fall move, newly acquired supply centers become owned by the occupying player, and each power's supply center total is recalculated; players with fewer supply centers than units on the board must disband units, while players with more supply centers than units on the board are entitled to build units in their open (unoccupied) Home centers (supply centers controlled at the start of the game). Players who have lost all of their Home centers may not build new units, while players controlling no supply centers are eliminated from the game. If a player controls 18 or more (being more than half) of the 34 supply centers at the end of a year, they are the winner. Players who remain may also agree to a draw \u2013 around half of all games will end in a draw.\n\nYou are playing as []. The other players are playing as the following powers: AUSTRIA, ENGLAND, FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, RUSSIA, TURKEY. There are no neutral powers in this game. The action space is the set of possible orders that you can issue to your units. You can issue orders to move your units to different locations, support other players' units, hold your units in place, or convoy your units across sea zones.\n"

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"step_by_step_reasoning\": \"Your step by step reasoning here\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **step_by_step_reasoning:**\n     - Provide your above step by step reasoning details in the \"step_by_step_reasoning\" field.\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'FRANCE': {'BRE': ['A BRE - PAR', 'A BRE - KIE VIA', 'A BRE - YOR VIA', 'A BRE - SWE VIA', 'A BRE - EDI VIA', 'A BRE S A PIC', 'A BRE - PIC VIA', 'A BRE - PIC', 'A BRE S A SPA - GAS', 'A BRE - NWY VIA', 'A BRE S A WAL - PIC', 'A BRE S A BUR - GAS', 'A BRE - DEN VIA', 'A BRE H', 'A BRE - WAL VIA', 'A BRE S A BUR - PIC', 'A BRE - LVP VIA', 'A BRE S A PIC - PAR', 'A BRE - GAS', 'A BRE - LON VIA', 'A BRE - BEL VIA', 'A BRE S A MAR - GAS', 'A BRE S F ENG - PIC', 'A BRE - HOL VIA', 'A BRE S A BUR - PAR'], 'BUR': ['A BUR - RUH', 'A BUR - MUN', 'A BUR - BEL', 'A BUR S A MAR', 'A BUR H', 'A BUR S A PIC - BEL', 'A BUR - PIC', 'A BUR S A BRE - PAR', 'A BUR S A RUH - MUN', 'A BUR - GAS', 'A BUR S A SPA - MAR', 'A BUR S A WAL - BEL', 'A BUR S A MAR - GAS', 'A BUR S A RUH', 'A BUR S A BRE - GAS', 'A BUR S F NTH - BEL', 'A BUR S A BRE - BEL', 'A BUR S A WAL - PIC', 'A BUR - PAR', 'A BUR S A RUH - BEL', 'A BUR S F ENG - PIC', 'A BUR S A PIC - PAR', 'A BUR S A BRE - PIC', 'A BUR S F ENG - BEL', 'A BUR - MAR', 'A BUR S A SPA - GAS', 'A BUR S A PIC'], 'SPA': ['A SPA S A BUR - MAR', 'A SPA - TUN VIA', 'A SPA S A BRE - GAS', 'A SPA - POR', 'A SPA H', 'A SPA S A MAR - GAS', 'A SPA S A MAR', 'A SPA - NAF VIA', 'A SPA - GAS', 'A SPA S A BUR - GAS', 'A SPA - MAR'], 'WES': ['F WES S F ROM - TYS', 'F WES - LYO', 'F WES H', 'F WES S A SMY - TUN', 'F WES - NAF', 'F WES - MAO', 'F WES S A GRE - TUN', 'F WES S F IRI - MAO', 'F WES S F ION - TYS', 'F WES - SPA/SC', 'F WES S F ION - TUN', 'F WES C A SPA - NAF', 'F WES S A ALB - TUN', 'F WES - TYS', 'F WES S A SPA', 'F WES S A MAR - SPA', 'F WES S F ENG - MAO', 'F WES - TUN', 'F WES C A SPA - TUN']}}\n</possible_orders>\n\n### **Your Objective:**\n\nYour ultimate goal is absolute domination\u2014seize every supply center and crush your opposition to win!

          "content": "## Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n### 0. Recap of Previous Negotiations\n\n(Note: No notes are provided for this state.)\n\nSince no specific negotiations are provided, we'll proceed based on the current game state and anticipate potential moves from other powers.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Current State\n\n- **Our Supply Centers**: BRE, MAR, PAR, POR (Note: MAR is currently occupied by Germany's unit)\n- **Our Units**:\n  - **A BRE** (Army in Brest)\n  - **A BUR** (Army in Burgundy)\n  - **A SPA** (Army in Spain)\n  - **F WES** (Fleet in Western Mediterranean)\n\n- **Influence/Control**: PAR, BRE, WES, POR, BUR, SPA\n\n- **Enemy Units Adjacent to Us**:\n  - **Germany**:\n    - **A MAR** (Army in Marseilles) - Occupying our home supply center\n    - **A PIC** (Army in Picardy) - Adjacent to BRE and BUR\n    - **A RUH** (Army in Ruhr) - Adjacent to BUR\n  - **England**:\n    - **F ENG** (Fleet in English Channel) - Adjacent to BRE\n    - **A WAL** (Army in Wales) - Can move to BRE\n  - **Potential Threats**:\n    - England is poised to attack BRE with F ENG and A WAL.\n    - Germany may attempt to advance further into our territory.\n\n### 2. Planning to Take More Supply Centers\n\n- **Primary Objective**: Recapture MAR (Marseilles) from Germany.\n- **Secondary Objective**: Defend against England's likely attack on BRE.\n- **Considerations**:\n  - We likely cannot hold BRE against England's attack strength of 2.\n  - Germany cannot easily support MAR, as their adjacent units cannot support it.\n  - Recapturing MAR will restore our home supply center and strengthen our position.\n\n### 3. Possible Orders and Analysis\n\n#### **Unit: A BUR (Burgundy)**\n\n- **Possible Orders**:\n  - **A BUR - MAR**: Attack Marseilles.\n  - **A BUR H**: Hold in place.\n  - **A BUR S A BRE - PIC**: Support A BRE in attacking Picardy.\n\n- **Analysis**:\n  - **Attacking MAR**: Offers a chance to recapture our supply center.\n  - **Risk**: If we vacate BUR, Germany might move into it from RUH.\n  - **Decision**: Prioritize recapturing MAR to regain our supply center.\n\n#### **Unit: A SPA (Spain)**\n\n- **Possible Orders**:\n  - **A SPA S A BUR - MAR**: Support A BUR attacking MAR.\n  - **A SPA - MAR**: Attack MAR directly.\n  - **A SPA H**: Hold position to defend SPA.\n\n- **Analysis**:\n  - **Supporting A BUR - MAR**: Increases our attack strength to 2.\n  - **Direct Attack**: Without support, less likely to succeed.\n  - **Decision**: Support A BUR to ensure the attack on MAR succeeds.\n\n#### **Unit: F WES (Western Mediterranean)**\n\n- **Possible Orders**:\n  - **F WES - MAO**: Move to Mid-Atlantic Ocean.\n  - **F WES - LYO**: Move to Gulf of Lyon.\n  - **F WES H**: Hold position.\n\n- **Analysis**:\n  - **Moving to MAO**: Positions us to counter England's naval forces and defend our western coast.\n  - **Moving to LYO**: Could assist in future southern operations but less immediate benefit.\n  - **Decision**: Move to MAO to prepare for potential conflicts with England.\n\n#### **Unit: A BRE (Brest)**\n\n- **Possible Orders**:\n  - **A BRE H**: Hold in place.\n  - **A BRE - GAS**: Move to Gascogne.\n  - **A BRE - PAR**: Move to Paris.\n  - **A BRE - PIC**: Attack Picardy.\n\n- **Analysis**:\n  - **Holding**: Will likely be dislodged due to England's attack strength of 2.\n  - **Moving to GAS**: Preserves the unit for future operations.\n  - **Moving to PAR**: Doesn't offer strategic advantage.\n  - **Decision**: Move to GAS to retain the unit and potentially counter-attack in future turns.\n\n### 4. Verifying Orders Against Game Rules\n\n- **A BUR - MAR**:\n  - **Valid Move**: MAR is adjacent to BUR.\n  - **Attack Target**: MAR is occupied by Germany.\n  - **Support**: Supported by A SPA.\n- **A SPA S A BUR - MAR**:\n  - **Valid Support**: SPA is adjacent to MAR.\n  - **Supporting Correct Unit**: A BUR is indeed attacking MAR.\n- **F WES - MAO**:\n  - **Valid Move**: MAO is adjacent to WES.\n  - **Strategic Position**: Prepares defense against England.\n- **A BRE - GAS**:\n  - **Valid Move**: GAS is adjacent to BRE.\n  - **Preserving Unit**: Avoids being dislodged and keeps unit active.\n\n### 5. Finalizing the Plan\n\n- **Orders**:\n  - **A BUR - MAR**\n  - **A SPA S A BUR - MAR**\n  - **F WES - MAO**\n  - **A BRE - GAS**\n\n- **Risks**:\n  - **England will capture BRE**: Cannot be prevented this turn.\n  - **Germany may move into BUR**: Acceptable risk to recapture MAR.\n  - **Potential Bounce in GAS**: If Germany moves A MAR - GAS, both units will bounce.\n\n- **Strategic Focus**: Regain MAR, prepare naval defenses, preserve units for future actions.\n\n### Verification Against Rules and Objectives\n\n- **Objectives Met**:\n  - Retaking a supply center (MAR).\n  - Maintaining unit positions for future offensives.\n- **Rules Compliance**:\n  - All moves are to adjacent regions.\n  - Support orders are valid and correctly formatted.\n  - No moves target our own unit locations improperly.\n\n## Final JSON Object\n\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"F1903M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Our main goal is to recapture Marseilles (MAR), our home supply center currently occupied by Germany, and to defend against potential attacks from Germany and England.

We are moving F WES to MAO to prepare to counter England's naval presence and to defend our western coast. Since we cannot hold BRE against an English attack with strength 2, we will move A BRE to GAS to preserve the unit and possibly retake BRE in future turns.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Strategic Goals and Planning\n\nOur primary goal is to expand our control over more supply centers. Potential targets include:\n\n- **Burgundy (BUR):** Currently occupied by Germany and adjacent to our units in PIC and MAR.\n- **Holland (HOL):** Controlled by Germany and adjacent to our fleet in BEL.\n- **Venice (VEN):** An Italian supply center adjacent to our army in PIE.\n- **Brest (BRE):** Controlled by England and adjacent to our units in PIC and GAS.\n\nGiven Germany's strong presence and the immediate threat it poses, focusing on German territories like BUR and HOL is strategic. Additionally, attempting to seize VEN from Italy could catch them off-guard, expanding our influence in the south.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Possible Orders Analysis\n\n#### **Unit: F BEL (Belgium)**\n\n- **Possible Orders:**\n  - **Attack:**\n    - `F BEL - HOL` (Move to Holland)\n    - `F BEL - ENG` (Move to English Channel)\n    - `F BEL - NTH` (Move to North Sea)\n  - **Support:**\n    - `F BEL S A PIC` (Support Army PIC)\n  - **Hold:**\n    - `F BEL H` (Hold position)\n- **Decision:**\n  - **Order:** `F BEL - HOL`\n  - **Reasoning:** Attempting to capture Holland, a supply center held by Germany. This move puts pressure on Germany and may disrupt their northern defenses.\n\n#### **Unit: A PIC (Picardy)**\n\n- **Possible Orders:**\n  - **Attack:**\n    - `A PIC - BUR` (Move to Burgundy)\n    - `A PIC - BRE` (Move to Brest)\n    - `A PIC - PAR` (Move to Paris)\n  - **Support:**\n    - `A PIC S A RUH - BUR` (Support German attack?)\n  - **Hold:**\n    - `A PIC H` (Hold position)\n- **Decision:**\n  - **Order:** `A PIC - BUR`\n  - **Reasoning:** Attack Burgundy to challenge German control. With support from A GAS and A MAR, we have a chance to dislodge the German army in BUR.\n\n#### **Unit: A GAS (Gascony)**\n\n- **Possible Orders:**\n  - **Support:**\n    - `A GAS S A PIC - BUR` (Support Army PIC moving to BUR)\n  - **Attack/Move:**\n    - `A GAS - BRE` (Move to Brest)\n    - `A GAS - BUR` (Move to Burgundy)\n    - `A GAS - PAR` (Move to Paris)\n  - **Hold:**\n    - `A GAS H` (Hold position)\n- **Decision:**\n  - **Order:** `A GAS S A PIC - BUR`\n  - **Reasoning:** Providing support to A PIC in the attack on Burgundy increases our chances of success.\n\n#### **Unit: A MAR (Marseilles)**\n\n- **Possible Orders:**\n  - **Support:**\n    - `A MAR S A PIC - BUR` (Support Army PIC moving to BUR)\n  - **Attack/Move:**\n    - `A MAR - BUR` (Move to Burgundy)\n    - `A MAR - GAS` (Move to Gascony)\n    - `A MAR - SPA` (Move to Spain)\n    - `A MAR - PIE` (Move to Piedmont)\n  - **Hold:**\n    - `A MAR H` (Hold position)\n- **Decision:**\n  - **Order:** `A MAR S A PIC - BUR`\n  - **Reasoning:** Further supporting the attack on Burgundy maximizes our strength in the assault against Germany.\n\n#### **Unit: A PIE (Piedmont)**\n\n- **Possible Orders:**\n  - **Attack/Move:**\n    - `A PIE - VEN` (Move to Venice)\n    - `A PIE - TYR` (Move to Tyrolia)\n    - `A PIE - TUS` (Move to Tuscany)\n    - `A PIE - MAR` (Move to Marseilles)\n  - **Hold:**\n    - `A PIE H` (Hold position)\n- **Decision:**\n  - **Order:** `A PIE - VEN`\n  - **Reasoning:** Attempting to capture Venice, an Italian supply center. Italy's units are distant, and VEN may be unoccupied, providing an opportunity for us to expand in the south.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Verification of Orders\n\n- **All move targets are adjacent to the units making the moves.**\n- **We are not moving into our own regions except for strategic attacks.**\n- **Attack targets are in regions controlled by other powers (Germany and Italy).**\n- **Supports are properly directed to units that are attacking the specified targets.**\n- **Our attacks have as much support as possible given our unit positions.**\n\n---\n\n### 5.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location.

Therefore, we'll proceed based solely on the current game state and make decisions accordingly.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Current State\n\n**Our Power**: France\n\n**Supply Centers Controlled**: MAR (Marseille), PAR (Paris), SPA (Spain)\n\n**Our Units**:\n- **A MAR** (Army in Marseille)\n- **A GAS** (Army in Gascony)\n- **A PAR** (Army in Paris)\n\n**Regions We Influence or Control**:\n- MAR, GAS, PAR, WES (Western Mediterranean Sea), PIE (Piedmont), PIC (Picardy), HEL (Helgoland Bight)\n\n**Adjacent Regions**:\n- **A PAR**: BUR (Burgundy), BRE (Brest), GAS (Gascony), PIC (Picardy)\n- **A GAS**: BUR, BRE, MAO (Mid-Atlantic Ocean), MAR, PAR, SPA/NC (North Coast of Spain)\n- **A MAR**: BUR, GAS, LYO (Gulf of Lyon), PIE, SPA/SC (South Coast of Spain), SWI (Switzerland)\n\n**Other Powers' Units Adjacent to Us**:\n- **Germany**:\n  - **A BUR** (Army in Burgundy)\n  - **A BRE** (Army in Brest)\n  - **F MAO** (Fleet in Mid-Atlantic Ocean)\n\n**Potential Threats**:\n- Germany is our immediate threat with units adjacent to our territories.\n- We have lost control of BRE (Brest), our home supply center, now occupied by Germany.\n- Germany could potentially launch attacks on PAR (Paris) or GAS (Gascony).\n\n### Step 2: Goals and Planning\n\n- **Primary Goal**: Defend our key supply centers, especially PAR (Paris).\n- **Secondary Goal**: Regain control of BRE (Brest) if possible.\n- **Challenges**:\n  - Germany may have strong defenses with potential support from adjacent units.\n  - Attacking without sufficient support could leave us vulnerable to counterattacks.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Possible Orders for Each Unit\n\n#### **Unit A PAR (Army in Paris)**\n\n- **Possible Orders**:\n  - **Hold**: Strengthen defense of PAR.\n  - **Move to BRE**: Attempt to recapture BRE.\n  - **Move to BUR**: Attack German unit in BUR.\n  - **Support Orders**: Support our other units.\n\n- **Analysis**:\n  - **Attacking BRE**:\n    - Risky due to potential German support from A BUR and F MAO.\n    - Likely insufficient support to succeed.\n  - **Attacking BUR**:\n    - Possible with support but risks leaving PAR undefended.\n  - **Holding Position**:\n    - Best option to ensure we don't lose PAR to German attack.\n\n#### **Unit A GAS (Army in Gascony)**\n\n- **Possible Orders**:\n  - **Support A PAR**: Strengthen defense of PAR.\n  - **Move to BUR or BRE**: Attack German positions.\n  - **Hold or Move**: Less advantageous in current situation.\n\n- **Analysis**:\n  - **Supporting A PAR**:\n    - Provides additional defense against potential German attacks.\n  - **Attacking BUR or BRE**:\n    - Risky and unlikely to succeed without additional support.\n\n#### **Unit A MAR (Army in Marseille)**\n\n- **Possible Orders**:\n  - **Support A PAR**: Contribute to defending PAR.\n  - **Move to BUR**: Join an attack on BUR.\n  - **Hold Position**: Maintain current position.\n\n- **Analysis**:\n  - **Supporting A PAR**:\n    - Maximizes defensive strength at PAR.\n  - **Attacking BUR**:\n    - Unlikely to succeed without sufficient support.\n    - Could leave MAR vulnerable.\n\n### Step 4: Decision on Orders\n\nAfter analyzing our options, the safest and most strategic choice is to focus on defending PAR:\n\n- **A PAR H**: Hold position in Paris.\n- **A GAS S A PAR**: Support A PAR to hold.\n- **A MAR S A PAR**: Support A PAR to hold.\n\nThis maximizes our defensive strength at PAR, ensuring we can repel any German attack with up to a strength of 3.\n\n### Step 5: Verification of Orders\n\n- **Compliance with Rules**:\n  - All units are issuing valid orders.\n  - Support orders are to adjacent units and valid targets.\n- **Strategic Justification**:\n  - Orders prioritize the defense of our crucial supply center.\n  - Avoids unnecessary risks with low probability of success.\n- **Potential Enemy Moves Considered**:\n  - Anticipated German attacks on PAR.\n  - Possibility of German support for their units.\n\n### Final Plan and Orders\n\nWe are confident in our defensive strategy for this turn.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>\n     - Example: `[{\"MUN\": [\"TYR\", \"BOH\"]}, ...]`\n\n   - **other_power_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**\n     - A list of integers (0 or 1).\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list.\n     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)\n     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.\n     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`\n\n   - **attackable:**\n     - A list of locations.\n     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.\n     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'FRANCE': {}}\n</possible_orders>\n\n### **Your Objective:**\n\nYour ultimate goal is absolute domination\u2014seize every supply center and crush your opposition to win! Build and expand relentlessly, taking control of regions by launching bold, decisive attacks, control as many supply center as you can. Strike hard, strike fast, and let nothing stand in your way. Victory belongs to the bold\u2014go conquer it!\n\n"

Recap of Previous Negotiation Phase\n\nNo notes are provided for this state, so we have no information about any agreements, promises, or threats made by other powers during the negotiation phase.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Current State\n\n- **Supply Centers Controlled:**\n  - We control **Marseilles (MAR)**.\n\n- **Units:**\n  - We have **no units** on the board.\n\n- **Our Influence:**\n  - Regions influenced: **Helgoland Bight (HEL)**, **Burgundy (BUR)**.\n\n- **Other Powers:**\n  - **Germany** is the dominant power, controlling many regions, including our home centers **Brest (BRE)** and **Paris (PAR)**. Germany also has an **Army in Marseilles (A MAR)**, indicating they occupy our sole supply center.\n  - **England** controls nearby regions and has units in **Liverpool (A LVP)**, **London (F LON)**, and **Spain's South Coast (F SPA/SC)**.\n  - **Austria**, **Italy**, **Russia**, and **Turkey** are controlling regions further from our position.\n\n### 2. Goal Analysis\n\nOur ultimate goal is to regain strength by controlling supply centers and rebuilding our forces. However, since we have no units and Germany occupies our only supply center, we are in a critical position.\n\n### 3. Possible Orders for Our Units\n\n- **Units Available:** None.\n- **Possible Actions:**\n  - Since we have no units, we cannot issue any orders this turn.\n\n### 4. Order Decision\n\n- There are **no orders** to make this turn due to the absence of units.\n\n### 5. Verification\n\n- **Move Targets:** Not applicable.\n- **Support Orders:** Not applicable.\n- **Attacks:** Not applicable.\n- **Compliance with Rules:**\n  - Our lack of units and builds means we cannot violate any game rules this turn.\n\n## Final Decision\n\nGiven the current state, we cannot issue any orders. Our focus should be on future opportunities to rebuild if circumstances change.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n  \"phase\": \"F1910M\",\n  \"reason\": \"As France, we currently have no units and only control one supply center at Marseilles (MAR), which is occupied by a German army.

Diplomacy is a 7-player turn based game, where players must use negotiation and strategy to control the most supply centers on the map. The players can move their units to different locations on the map, and can support other players' units to help them succeed. The game is played on a map of Europe, divided into territories and sea zones. The players can issue orders to their units to move, support, hold, or convoy. The game ends when one player controls 18 supply centers.\n\n34 of the land provinces are supply centers. Possession of these supply centers allows the powers who control them to raise and maintain armies and fleets. As they are also a central part of the game's victory conditions, they are the focus of much of the game's activity.\n\nEach player is given three (save for Russia, which has four) home supply centers. These spaces are the starting point for their owning power's initial forces. The players can then build new units at these home supply centers as they capture further supply centers. New units can only be built on a power's home supply centers. If a power loses all of its home supply centers it may continue to play; however, it may not build new units until it has recaptured at least one of its home supply centers.\n\nIn Diplomacy, there are two types of units: Armies and Fleets. An army can travel in land spaces and coastal land spaces, and a fleet can travel in sea spaces and coastal land spaces.\n\nAll units in Diplomacy move only one space at a time and only one unit may occupy any space at any time. The exception to this rule comes in the form of a successful convoy, where a convoyed army may travel multiple spaces depending on the length of the chain created by the convoying fleets. A convoyed army must embark from a coastal land province and land at a coastal land province.\n\nDiplomacy proceeds by seasons, beginning in the year 1901, with each year divided into two main seasons: the \"Spring\" and \"Fall\" (Autumn) moves. Each season is further divided into negotiation and movement phases, followed by \"retreat\" or \"disband\" adjustments and an end-of-the-year Winter phase of new builds or removals following the Fall adjustments.\n                                  \nNegotiation phase\n\nIn the negotiation phase, players discuss tactics and strategy, form alliances, and share intelligence or spread disinformation. Negotiations may be made public or kept private. Players are not bound to anything they say or promise, and no agreements are enforceable.\nCommunication and trust are highly important; players must forge alliances with others and observe their actions to evaluate their trustworthiness. At the same time, they must convince others of their own trustworthiness while making plans to turn against their allies when least expected. A well-timed betrayal can be just as profitable as an enduring, reliable alliance.\n\nMovement phase\n\nAfter the negotiation period, players write secret orders for each unit; these orders are revealed and executed simultaneously. A unit can move from its location to an adjacent space, support an adjacent unit to hold an area in the event of an attack, support another unit to attack a space into which it could move itself, or hold defensively. In addition, fleets may transport armies from one coast space to another when in a chain called a \"convoy\". Armies may only occupy land regions, and fleets occupy sea regions and the land regions that border named seas. Only one unit may occupy each region. If multiple units are ordered to move to the same region, only the unit with the most support moves there. If two or more units have the same highest support, a standoff occurs and no units ordered to that region move. A unit ordered to give support that is attacked has those orders canceled and is forced to hold, except in the case that support is being given to a unit invading the region from which the attack originated (in which case the unit that had been ordered to give support must retreat from, rather than hold, its position).\nCertain spaces on the board have two coasts and here a player must specify which one they want their fleet to occupy. A fleet can only move to coasts and oceans that border the coast that it is on. For example, a fleet occupying the southern coast of Bulgaria cannot move into Romania or the Black Sea, but a fleet on the east coast could.\n\nIn the game of Diplomacy, an action space is the collection of all the legal actions that each country or unit can take in each round. The following are common types of actions in games and their common formats:\n\n1. Attack/Move\n\nThis order moves the unit in one province to an adjacent province. Of course, armies cannot move into sea provinces, and fleets cannot move into landlocked provinces.\n\nA unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere.\n\nTwo units may not swap provinces, unless there is a convoy involved. \n\nThe format is:\n\nA [province] - [target province] (Army moves from current position to target province)\nF [province] - [target province] (Fleet moves from current position to target province)\nFor example:\n\nA BER - MUN indicates that the army from Berlin moved to Munich.\nF NTH - ENG indicates the movement of the fleet from the North Sea (NTH) to the English Channel (ENG).\n\nWhen the destination province is occupied by another unit, they do not move, unless either are attacked or defended by stronger support. When two units with equal support try to move into the same destination province, for instance:\n\nGermany\nA MUN - TYR\n\nItaly\nA VEN - TYR\n\nNeither of the two units can go into Tyrolia. Army Venice will stay in Venice, and Army Munich will stay in Munich. Again, this is assuming that these two units are the only two units in this little battle, and that they have equal support for their moves.\n\n2. Support\n\nSupport is the trickiest aspect of the rules, and the most important of the game. Support may involve cooperation between two (or more) powers, and is the only way to make forward progress through enemy territory (unless you can convince the enemy to let you in). Simply put, more support defeats less support.\n\nThe support order is given in reference to another unit's move. That other unit's move must be to a province into which the supporting unit could otherwise move. Support may also be given to a unit holding its position. In addition, units giving support can themselves be supported in their holding position.\n\nSupport is a unit's sole action for a given move, and supporting units remain where they are (unless they are attacked by greater support and have to retreat or disband during the retreat phase).\n\nA country cannot dislodge or support the dislodgement of one of its own units, although if same country's units attempt to move into the same province with equal support, neither will succeed as normal.\n\nCutting Support: If the supporting unit is attacked during the turn by some other unit, its support is cut. In effect, the support order becomes a hold order, as the unit must defend its province against the attack. Note that a unit occupying the province into which the support is directed cannot cut support, unless its attack successfully dislodges the supporting unit. An attack by a country on one of its own units also doesn't cut support.\n\nThe format is:\n\nA [province] S A [target province] - [destination] (support army movement)\nA [province] S A [target province] (supporting the garrisoning of the army)\nF [province] S F [target province] - [destination] (Support fleet movement)\nF [province] S F [target province] (garrisoning of supporting fleet)\nFor example:\n\nA BER S A MUN indicated that the Army in Berlin supported the Army garrison in Munich.\nA BER S A MUN-KIE stated that the Army of Berlin supported the Army of Munich in moving to Kiel.\n\nOther example:\n\nNB: Below are complete orders as submitted by all 7 Powers for the Fall 1907 campaign season of a made-up game to help you understand the intricacies of supporting and breaking support. Having a game map to look on with is highly recommended; the one provided at the top of this page is adequate.\n\n\nWe'll start with:\n\n--Germany--\nArmy Ruhr to Holland\nFleet Kiel supports Army Ruhr to Holland\nArmy Munich supports Army Ruhr to Holland\nNote that in this case the order for Munich to support Ruhr into Holland would not work because Munich does not border Holland and thus cannot support Ruhr in (Munich could, however, support Ruhr if Ruhr were simply holding). The rule for supporting an attack is that a supporting unit must border the province being attacked, but need not border the attacker's province of origin (to support a unit to hold, however, the supporting unit must border the supported unit). Essentially, the supporting unit must border the destination of the supported unit, whether it is its own province or a new province entirely. In sum, Ruhr is actually attacking Holland with the support of only one unit (Fleet Kiel).\n\nArmy Prussia supports Army Silesia\nArmy Silesia supports Army Prussia\nHere, Army Prussia is supported by one unit, and Army Silesia is supported by one unit. The last two moves are legal, and this method of double-support is helpful when there are two units that both could be attacked and dislodged. Of course, if both units are attacked, the support fails.\n\n\n--England--\nArmy London to Holland\nFleet North Sea convoys Army London to Holland (<-- a convoy)\nFleet Heligoland Bight supports Army London to Holland\nNote that the convoying fleet is not considered to be giving support, so Army London actually has support from only one unit: Fleet Heligoland-Bight.\n\nArmy Denmark to Kiel\nHere England interferes with Germany's plans (see Germany, above) by attacking Kiel with Army Denmark. This cuts the support of Fleet Kiel to Army Ruhr, thereby leaving Army Ruhr's attack on Holland unsupported.\n\nArmy London, on the other hand, (see above) is supported in its attack on Holland by one unit (Fleet Heligoland-Bight), thereby enabling Army London to be convoyed successfully into Holland, as long as Fleet North Sea is not dislodged during the convoy.\n\nArmy Picardy to Brest\nFleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean supports Army Picardy to Brest\nFleet English Channel supports Army Picardy to Brest\nHere Army Picardy is supported by both Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean and Fleet English Channel to move into Brest. Unless the French successfully defend it, England will also take Brest.\n\n\n--France--\n\nFleet Gascony to Mid-Atlantic Ocean\nFleet Irish Sea to English Channel\nFleet Gascony and Fleet Irish Sea cut the support by Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean and Fleet English Channel for England's Army Picardy (see England, above). Therefore, Army Picardy is now attacking Brest unsupported.\n\nFleet Brest holds\nArmy Paris supports Fleet Brest\nArmy Paris supports Fleet Brest, and so Army Picardy\u2019s now unsupported attempt to move into Brest fails.\n\nArmy Burgundy to Ruhr\nArmy Burgundy does not successfully move into Ruhr because Army Ruhr\u2019s move to Holland failed (see Germany and England, above).\n\n\n--Russia--\n\nFleet Sevastopol holds\nArmy Moscow supports Fleet Sevastopol\n\nFleet Sevastopol is supported by Army Moscow.\n\nFleet St. Petersburg (North Coast) to Norway\nArmy Finland supports Fleet St. Petersburg (North Coast) to Norway\n\nNorway is not occupied, so Russia takes it immediately.\n\nArmy Livonia to Prussia\n\nUnsupported Army Livonia attempts to move into Prussia, but since Army Prussia is supported by Army Silesia (see Germany, above), the attack is not successful.\n\n\n--Austria-Hungary--\n\nArmy Ukraine supports Fleet Sevastopol\n\nArmy Ukraine supports Fleet Sevastopol, so there are now two units supporting (see Russia, above). In fact, international support is necessary in alliances, whether supporting each other in defence or to attack another Power.\n\nFleet Trieste holds\nArmy Budapest supports Fleet Trieste\nArmy Vienna supports Fleet Trieste\n\nThere are two units supporting Fleet Trieste: Army Budapest and Army Vienna.\n\n\n--Turkey--\n\nArmy Galicia to Ukraine\n\nArmy Galicia cuts the Austrian support to Sevastopol, thereby decreasing the support to Sevastopol by one unit (see Austria and Russia, above).\n\nFleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\nArmy Armenia supports Fleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\nArmy Rumania supports Fleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\n\nNow, since Fleet Black Sea is supported by two units into Sevastopol, Fleet Black Sea moves into Sevastopol, and Fleet Sevastopol has to be disbanded or retreat. A retreating fleet that is displaced by another force can only retreat into a movable space (i.e. a sea or coastal province that is vacant) which may not be the same space that was previously occupied by the displacing unit.\n\nSince Fleet Sevastopol has nowhere to retreat, it disbands automatically.\n\n\n--Italy--\n\nArmy Apulia to Trieste\nFleet Adriatic Sea convoys Army Apulia to Trieste\nArmy Venezia supports Army Apulia to Trieste\nFleet Albania supports Army Apulia to Trieste\n\nThere are two units supporting Army Apulia into Trieste, but since Fleet Trieste is supported by two units (see Austria-Hungary, above), the attack bounces.\n\nFinally note that the orders for both the army being convoyed and the fleet doing the convoying must use the proper protocol and fully identify the units involved in the convoy. This is a complex manoeuver and becomes more complex if it involves units controlled by more than one power.\n\n3. Hold\nThis is the default for all units (what they will do if not given any other orders). The unit will stay in its position, and will not move, support, convoy, or do anything. Holding units can be supported by units in neighboring provinces or be attacked by foreign units. If the attacking unit has more units supporting it than the holding unit, the holding unit is ousted from that province and must either retreat or disband. The format is:\n\nA [province] H (Army garrison)\nF [province] H (Fleet garrison)\nFor example:\n\nA BER H means the Army garrison in Berlin.\n\n4. Convoy (Occupation)\n\nThis move is used to transfer army units across sea spaces, or to move large distances in one move. Only armies may be convoyed, and only fleets may convoy.\n\nThe fleet may choose to transport an army from one coastal province to another. The operation requires the collaboration of multiple fleets, especially over long distances. The format is:\n\nF [province] C A [origin province] - [destination province]\nFor example:\n\nF ENG C A LON-BRE refers to the fleet in the English Channel transporting the Army of London to Brest (BRE).\n\nA convoy order would be:\n\n--England--\nA YOR - NOR\nFleet North Sea convoys Army Yorkshire to Norway\n\nArmy Yorkshire will move to Norway, unless another unit should prevent this process by dislodging or destroying the convoying fleet. If a convoy order fails and the convoyed piece could not ordinarily move there without the convoy, the convoyed army unit holds.\n\nThe unit being convoyed can be supported into its destination space by any other units that border the destination space, just like any other support. However, if the convoying fleet is dislodged, it cannot convoy the unit and the entire move will fail. Note that convoys are not \"broken\" as easily as support; a convoying fleet that is attacked but not dislodged will successfully carry out its convoy order.\n\nConvoying fleets can be supported to prevent them from being dislodged or destroyed. Convoying fleets cannot perform any other order.\n\nA fleet on a coastal space may not convoy.\n\nIf an army can arrive to its destination either by land or convoy, convoy is used if at least one of the convoying fleets belongs to the army's owner, or if army's owner specified \"via convoy\" on the army's move order; otherwise, land route is used.\n\nIf several fleets are convoying an army so that it can take multiple routes to its destination, convoy succeeds as long as at least one convoy route remains open.\n\n5. Build\nDuring the specified construction phase of the game, the country in control can choose to build new units (army or fleet) in the supply center, provided that there are supply centers available and it does not exceed its maximum number of supply centers.\n\nFor example:\n\nBuild A BER means to build a new army in Berlin.\n\n6. Disband\nUnits may choose to disband, usually when defeated or strategically necessary.\n\nSyntax:\n\n// Comments\n// -----------------------------\n// Order Syntax\n// -----------------------------\n// *** Recommended syntax **\nA LON H\nF IRI - MAO\nA IRI - MAO VIA\nA WAL S F LON\nA WAL S F MAO - IRI\nF NWG C A NWY - EDI\nA IRO R MAO\nA IRO D\nA LON B\nF LIV B\n\n// Support\nA WAL S F LON\nWAL S LON\nA WAL S LON\nF WAL S F MAO - IRI\n\n// Convoy\nF NWG C A NWY - EDI\nNWG C NWY - EDI\n\n// Retreat (Retreat Phase)\nA IRO R MAO\nRETREAT IRO - MAO\nA IRO D\nRETREAT IRO DISBAND\n\n// Build\nA LON B\nF LIV B\nBUILD A LON\nBUILD F LIV\n\n// Remove\nF LIV D\nREMOVE F LIV\nDISBAND F LIV\n\n// Waive\nWAIVE\n\nThe range of action space per turn\nAt each turn, players can choose a combination of actions to perform on the units they control, which can be moves, supports, garrisons, capture, etc.\n                                  \nEnd-of-year and supply centers\nAfter each Fall move, newly acquired supply centers become owned by the occupying player, and each power's supply center total is recalculated; players with fewer supply centers than units on the board must disband units, while players with more supply centers than units on the board are entitled to build units in their open (unoccupied) Home centers (supply centers controlled at the start of the game). Players who have lost all of their Home centers may not build new units, while players controlling no supply centers are eliminated from the game. If a player controls 18 or more (being more than half) of the 34 supply centers at the end of a year, they are the winner. Players who remain may also agree to a draw \u2013 around half of all games will end in a draw.\n\nYou are playing as []. The other players are playing as the following powers: AUSTRIA, ENGLAND, FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, RUSSIA, TURKEY. There are no neutral powers in this game. The action space is the set of possible orders that you can issue to your units. You can issue orders to move your units to different locations, support other players' units, hold your units in place, or convoy your units across sea zones.\n"

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"step_by_step_reasoning\": \"Your step by step reasoning here\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **step_by_step_reasoning:**\n     - Provide your above step by step reasoning details in the \"step_by_step_reasoning\" field.\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"step_by_step_reasoning\": \"Your step by step reasoning here\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **step_by_step_reasoning:**\n     - Provide your above step by step reasoning details in the \"step_by_step_reasoning\" field.\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported.

The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'ITALY': {'NAP': ['F NAP -

          "content": "Let me analyze the game state step by step:\n\n0. Negotiation Phase Recap:\n   - No specific negotiation details were provided in the initial setup.\n\n1. Current Game State Analysis:\n   - Italy's Current Situation:\n     * Controlling 4 supply centers: NAP, ROM, VEN, TRI\n     * Units: F NAP, F ROM, A VEN, A SER\n     * Strategic Position: Relatively stable, but limited expansion opportunities\n\n   - Potential Targets:\n     * Austria (nearby and potentially vulnerable)\n     * Turkey (could be an interesting expansion target)\n\n2. Strategic Objectives:\n   - Expand control of supply centers\n   - Weaken nearby powers\n   - Secure strategic positions\n\n3. Unit Analysis:\n   - F NAP: Potential moves to APU or ION\n   - F ROM: Could support moves or threaten TUS\n   - A VEN: Potential move to TRI or PIE\n   - A SER: Flexible position, can support various moves\n\n4. Detailed Order Considerations:\n   4.1 Potential Attacks:\n       - A VEN could potentially attack TRI (Austrian territory)\n       - A SER could potentially move to TRI or support an attack\n       - F NAP could support movements\n\n   4.2 Support Opportunities:\n       - A SER can provide support to various moves\n       - F ROM can support coastal movements\n\n5. Strategic Reasoning:\n   - Aim to weaken Austria by pressuring TRI\n   - Create opportunities for expansion\n   - Maintain defensive positions\n\nBased on this analysis, here's my proposed strategy:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"F1902M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Strategically positioning to pressure Austria and create expansion opportunities in the Balkan region\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"NAP\", \"ROM\", \"VEN\", \"TRI\", \"SER\"],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"F NAP\", \"F ROM\", \"A VEN\", \"A SER\"],\n    \"adjacent\": [\n        {\"NAP\": [\"APU\", \"ION\", \"ROM\", \"TYS\"]},\n        {\"ROM\": [\"APU\", \"NAP\", \"TUS\", \"TYS\", \"VEN\"]},\n        {\"VEN\": [\"ADR\", \"APU\", \"PIE\", \"ROM\", \"TRI\", \"TUS\", \"TYR\"]},\n        {\"SER\": [\"ALB\", \"BUD\", \"BUL\", \"GRE\", \"RUM\", \"TRI\"]}\n    ],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"TRI\", \"BUD\"],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    \"attackable\": [\"TRI\", \"BUD\"],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [\n        {\"TRI\": 2},\n        {\"BUD\": 3}\n    ],\n    \"support_given\": [\n        {\"supporter\": \"A SER\", \"supported\": \"A VEN\", \"target\": \"TRI\"},\n        {\"supporter\": \"F ROM\", \"supported\": \"A VEN\", \"target\": \"TRI\"}\n    ],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"ITALY\": [1, 0, 1, 0]\n    },\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"ITALY\": [\n            \"A VEN - TRI\",\n            \"F ROM H\",\n            \"A SER S A VEN - TRI\",\n            \"F NAP - ION\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nKey Strategic Moves:\n1. A VEN attacks TRI with support from A SER\n2. F ROM holds to maintain position\n3. F NAP moves to ION to create strategic flexibility\n4. A SER supports the attack on TRI\n\nThe strategy aims to:\n- Pressure Austria by attacking TRI\n- Potentially weaken Austrian position\n- Create opportunities for future expansion\n- Maintain defensive positioning\n\nThe attack on TRI has support from both A VEN and A SER, increasing chances of success."

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'ITALY': {'ION': ['F ION -

Italy attempts to convoy A NAP to Greece with support from F ION and A SER\n2. Turkey supports A RUM's move to Budapest\n3. Defensive holds in other locations to maintain current positions\n\nThe strategy aims to:\n- Expand Italy's influence by gaining Greece\n- Support Turkey's potential move into Budapest\n- Maintain defensive positions in other regions\n\nThis approach balances expansion with defensive considerations, leveraging the strengths of both powers."

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful.

Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'ITALY': {'GRE': ['A GRE S A RUM -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Expand control of supply centers\n2. Weaken neighboring powers\n3. Create strategic positioning for future turns\n\n## Step 3: Detailed Unit Analysis and Potential Moves\n\n### Italy's Strategic Considerations:\n1. F AEG has multiple strategic options:\n   - Support movement into Greece\n   - Potentially convoy Bulgarian army\n   - Block other powers' sea movements\n\n2. A BUL can potentially move to:\n   - Greece\n   - Constantinople\n   - Support other movements\n\n3. A VEN could:\n   - Move to Trieste\n   - Move to Tyrolia\n   - Support other movements\n\n### Turkey's Strategic Considerations:\n1. A ARM can:\n   - Move to Syria\n   - Move to Sevastopol\n   - Support Black Sea movements\n\n2. F BLA has convoy and support capabilities\n\n3. A UKR can:\n   - Move to Galicia\n   - Move to Rumania\n   - Support other movements\n\n## Step 4: Potential Attack Strategies\n\n### Italy's Potential Attacks:\n- A BUL could attack Greece\n- A VEN could potentially move towards Trieste\n- F AEG could support movements in Aegean region\n\n### Turkey's Potential Attacks:\n- A ARM could move towards Sevastopol\n- A UKR could support movements in Rumania/Ukraine region\n\n## Step 5: Finalized Strategy\n\nAfter careful analysis, here's a strategic JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"F1904M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Coordinate Italian and Turkish movements to expand influence in Balkan and Black Sea regions, creating strategic pressure on neighboring powers\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"NAP\", \"ROM\", \"VEN\", \"TRI\", \"SER\", \"BUL\", \"ANK\", \"CON\", \"SMY\", \"MOS\"],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"F AEG\", \"F NAP\", \"F ROM\", \"A SER\", \"A BUL\", \"A VEN\", \"A ARM\", \"F BLA\", \"F CON\", \"A UKR\"],\n    \"adjacent\": [\n        {\"AEG\": [\"BUL/SC\", \"CON\", \"EAS\", \"GRE\", \"ION\", \"SMY\"]},\n        {\"BUL\": [\"SER\", \"RUM\", \"CON\", \"GRE\"]},\n        {\"ARM\": [\"SEV\", \"SMY\", \"ANK\"]}\n    ],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"RUM\", \"GRE\", \"SEV\"],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    \"attackable\": [\"RUM\", \"GRE\", \"SEV\"],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [\n        {\"GRE\": 2},\n        {\"RUM\": 3},\n        {\"SEV\": 2}\n    ],\n    \"support_given\": [\n        {\"supporter\": \"F AEG\", \"supported\": \"A BUL\", \"target\": \"GRE\"},\n        {\"supporter\": \"F BLA\", \"supported\": \"A UKR\", \"target\": \"RUM\"}\n    ],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"ITALY\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n        \"TURKEY\": [0, 1, 0, 1]\n    },\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"ITALY\": [\n            \"A BUL - GRE\",\n            \"F AEG S A BUL - GRE\",\n            \"A VEN H\",\n            \"F NAP H\",\n            \"F ROM H\",\n            \"A SER H\"\n        ],\n        \"TURKEY\": [\n            \"A UKR - RUM\",\n            \"F BLA S A UKR - RUM\",\n            \"A ARM - SEV\",\n            \"F CON H\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nStrategic Reasoning:\n1. Italy focuses on securing Greece through coordinated movement and support\n2. Turkey attempts to expand into Rumania and potentially Sevastopol\n3. Defensive postures maintained in other regions\n4. Collaborative strategy between Italy and Turkey to expand Balkan influence\n\nThe strategy aims to:\n- Expand territorial control\n- Minimize risk\n- Create pressure on neighboring powers\n- Maintain flexibility for future moves\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the strategy or analysis?"

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here.

The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'ITALY': {'GRE': ['A GRE S A RUM -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>\n     - Example: `[{\"MUN\": [\"TYR\", \"BOH\"]}, ...]`\n\n   - **other_power_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**\n     - A list of integers (0 or 1).\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list.\n     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region.

A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported.

The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'ITALY': {'GRE': ['A GRE S A RUM -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'ITALY': {'GRE': ['A GRE S A BUL', 'A GRE S A TUS -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>\n     - Example: `[{\"MUN\": [\"TYR\", \"BOH\"]}, ...]`\n\n   - **other_power_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**\n     - A list of integers (0 or 1).\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list.\n     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region.

A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'ITALY': {'GRE': ['A GRE S A BUL', 'A GRE S A TUS -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>\n     - Example: `[{\"MUN\": [\"TYR\", \"BOH\"]}, ...]`\n\n   - **other_power_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**\n     - A list of integers (0 or 1).\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list.\n     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)\n     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.\n     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`\n\n   - **attackable:**\n     - A list of locations.\n     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.\n     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'ITALY': {'ION': ['F ION -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>\n     - Example: `[{\"MUN\": [\"TYR\", \"BOH\"]}, ...]`\n\n   - **other_power_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**\n     - A list of integers (0 or 1).\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list.\n     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region.

The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'ITALY': {'ALB': ['F ALB H', 'F ALB S A VEN -

Verification of Strategic Moves:\n   - Ensure attacks have sufficient support\n   - Avoid moving into own controlled regions\n   - Maximize potential for supply center acquisition\n\nBased on this analysis, here's a proposed strategy:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"F1908M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Strategic push to destabilize Austria and potentially gain territory in the Balkans\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"NAP\", \"VEN\", \"TRI\", \"SER\"],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"SER\", \"ALB\", \"TYS\", \"TRI\"],\n    \"adjacent\": [\n        {\"SER\": [\"ALB\", \"BUD\", \"BUL\", \"GRE\", \"RUM\", \"TRI\"]},\n        {\"ALB\": [\"ADR\", \"GRE\", \"ION\", \"SER\", \"TRI\"]},\n        {\"TRI\": [\"ADR\", \"ALB\", \"BUD\", \"SER\", \"TYR\", \"VEN\", \"VIE\"]},\n        {\"TYS\": [\"ION\", \"LYO\", \"ROM\", \"NAP\", \"TUN\", \"TUS\", \"WES\"]}\n    ],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"VIE\", \"BUD\", \"GRE\"],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    \"attackable\": [\"VIE\", \"BUD\", \"GRE\"],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [\n        {\"VIE\": 2},\n        {\"BUD\": 2},\n        {\"GRE\": 1}\n    ],\n    \"support_given\": [\n        {\"supporter\": \"SER\", \"supported\": \"TRI\", \"target\": \"VIE\"},\n        {\"supporter\": \"ALB\", \"supported\": \"TRI\", \"target\": \"VIE\"}\n    ],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"AUSTRIA\": [1, 1, 0, 0],\n        \"TURKEY\": [0, 0, 0, 0]\n    },\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"ITALY\": [\n            \"A TRI - VIE\",\n            \"A SER S A TRI - VIE\",\n            \"F ALB S A TRI - VIE\",\n            \"F TYS H\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nThe strategy focuses on:\n1. Attacking Vienna with multiple supports\n2. Using Serbia and Albania to support the attack\n3. Holding Tyrrhenian Sea for strategic flexibility\n4.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'ITALY': {'ALB': ['F ALB H', 'F ALB S F ION', 'F ALB S A SER -

Negotiation Phase Context:\n   - No specific previous negotiation details were provided\n   - Focus will be on strategic territorial expansion\n\n1. Current State Analysis:\n   - ITALY Units:\n     * A SER (Serbia)\n     * F ALB (Albania)\n     * F TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea)\n\n   - ITALY Supply Centers: \n     * NAP, VEN, SER (3 total)\n\n   - Strategic Position:\n     * Centrally located in Balkans\n     * Potential for expansion into Balkans and Mediterranean\n     * Limited naval and land unit count\n\n2. Expansion Strategy:\n   - Immediate Targets:\n     * Greece (potential weak point)\n     * Romania/Bulgaria region\n     * Adriatic Sea area\n\n3. Unit Analysis and Possible Moves:\n\n   For A SER (Serbia):\n   - Can move to: TRI, RUM, BUD, BUL, GRE\n   - Most promising targets: TRI (Austria), RUM (potential Russian conflict)\n\n   For F ALB (Albania):\n   - Can move to: GRE, ION, TRI, ADR\n   - Best strategic move: Support movement into Greece or ION\n\n   For F TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea):\n   - Can move to: ROM, NAP, ION, LYO, WES\n   - Potential convoy operations\n\n4. Specific Strategic Considerations:\n   - Need to create opportunities for expansion\n   - Minimize risk of counterattacks\n   - Potentially collaborate with other powers against stronger opponents\n\n## Detailed Order Planning\n\nAfter careful analysis, here's a strategic JSON plan:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"S1909M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Expand into Balkan region, target weak Austrian and Russian positions, create naval mobility\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"SER\", \"ALB\", \"TYS\"],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"A SER\", \"F ALB\", \"F TYS\"],\n    \"adjacent\": [\n        {\"SER\": [\"ALB\", \"BUD\", \"BUL\", \"GRE\", \"RUM\", \"TRI\"]},\n        {\"ALB\": [\"ADR\", \"GRE\", \"ION\", \"SER\", \"TRI\"]},\n        {\"TYS\": [\"ION\", \"LYO\", \"ROM\", \"NAP\", \"TUN\", \"WES\"]}\n    ],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"GRE\", \"VIE\", \"RUM\"],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 0, 0],\n    \"attackable\": [\"GRE\", \"TRI\", \"RUM\"],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [\n        {\"GRE\": 2},\n        {\"TRI\": 2},\n        {\"RUM\": 1}\n    ],\n    \"support_given\": [\n        {\"supporter\": \"ALB\", \"supported\": \"SER\", \"target\": \"GRE\"},\n        {\"supporter\": \"TYS\", \"supported\": \"SER\", \"target\": \"RUM\"}\n    ],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"ITALY\": [1, 1, 0]\n    },\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"ITALY\": [\n            \"A SER - GRE\",\n            \"F ALB S A SER - GRE\",\n            \"F TYS S A SER - RUM\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nKey Strategic Rationale:\n1. Attack Greece with supported movement\n2. Use Albania fleet to support Serbia's move\n3. Use Tyrrhenian Sea fleet to support potential Romania attack\n4. Create pressure on Austrian and Russian borders\n5. Potentially open paths for future expansion\n\nThe orders aim to:\n- Capture Greece\n- Potentially threaten Romania\n- Maintain strategic positioning\n- Minimize defensive vulnerabilities\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the strategy or explain the reasoning behind the specific orders?"

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'ITALY': {'ALB': ['F ALB H', 'F ALB S A GRE', 'F ALB S A BUD - TRI', 'F ALB - GRE', 'F ALB S A VIE - TRI', 'F ALB - ADR', 'F ALB - ION', 'F ALB S A TYR - TRI', 'F ALB S F ION', 'F ALB S F TUN - ION', 'F ALB S F ION - GRE', 'F ALB S A BUL - GRE', 'F ALB - TRI', 'F ALB S F ION - ADR', 'F ALB S F TYS - ION'], 'GRE': ['A GRE S A BUL', 'A GRE S A RUM - SER', 'A GRE - SER', 'A GRE S F CON - BUL', 'A GRE H', 'A GRE - BUL', 'A GRE S F ALB', 'A GRE S F ION - ALB', 'A GRE - ROM VIA', 'A GRE - APU VIA', 'A GRE S A BUL - SER', 'A GRE - ALB', 'A GRE S F CON - BUL/EC', 'A GRE - ALB VIA', 'A GRE - TUS VIA', 'A GRE S F BLA - BUL/EC', 'A GRE S A SEV - BUL', 'A GRE S F CON - BUL/SC', 'A GRE S A RUM - BUL', 'A GRE S A BUD - SER', 'A GRE - NAP VIA', 'A GRE - TUN VIA', 'A GRE S F BLA - BUL'], 'TYS': ['F TYS S F ALB - ION', 'F TYS C A GRE - ROM', 'F TYS - ROM', 'F TYS S A GRE - NAP', 'F TYS - TUN', 'F TYS S F TUN - WES', 'F TYS - NAP', 'F TYS - LYO', 'F TYS - ION', 'F TYS S F ION', 'F TYS - WES', 'F TYS H', 'F TYS S F MAO - WES', 'F TYS S A GRE - TUN', 'F TYS S F TUN - ION', 'F TYS S F ION - NAP', 'F TYS C A GRE - TUS', 'F TYS - TUS', 'F TYS S F ION - TUN', 'F TYS S F TUN']}, 'TURKEY': {'ANK': ['F ANK S F BLA', 'F ANK - BLA', 'F ANK S A SEV - ARM', 'F ANK S A BUL - CON', 'F ANK S F CON', 'F ANK S A RUM - CON', 'F ANK S F BLA - ARM', 'F ANK H', 'F ANK S F CON - BLA', 'F ANK - ARM', 'F ANK S F BLA - CON', 'F ANK S A BUL - ARM', 'F ANK S A RUM - ARM', 'F ANK S A SEV - CON', 'F ANK - CON'], 'BLA': ['F BLA - ANK', 'F BLA H', 'F BLA S F ANK - ARM', 'F BLA S F ANK - CON', 'F BLA C A BUL - ARM', 'F BLA C A RUM - ANK', 'F BLA S A SEV', 'F BLA S A BUD - RUM', 'F BLA S A BUL', 'F BLA C A SEV - RUM', 'F BLA S A GRE - BUL', 'F BLA C A BUL - ANK', 'F BLA C A SEV - ARM', 'F BLA - RUM', 'F BLA S A BUL - RUM', 'F BLA C A BUL - RUM', 'F BLA - CON', 'F BLA C A SEV - ANK', 'F BLA S A RUM', 'F BLA - ARM', 'F BLA S F CON - BUL/EC', 'F BLA S F CON - BUL', 'F BLA C A BUL - SEV', 'F BLA C A RUM - BUL', 'F BLA C A RUM - ARM', 'F BLA C A SEV - CON', 'F BLA S A SEV - RUM', 'F BLA C A SEV - BUL', 'F BLA S A RUM - BUL', 'F BLA S A SEV - ARM', 'F BLA - SEV', 'F BLA S A RUM - SEV', 'F BLA S F CON - BUL/SC', 'F BLA C A BUL - CON', 'F BLA S A BUL - CON', 'F BLA - BUL/EC', 'F BLA S F ANK', 'F BLA C A RUM - CON', 'F BLA S F CON', 'F BLA S A GAL - RUM', 'F BLA S F CON - ANK', 'F BLA C A RUM - SEV'], 'CON': ['F CON S A BUL - ANK', 'F CON S A BUL', 'F CON - BUL/SC', 'F CON - BUL/EC', 'F CON S F ION - AEG', 'F CON - AEG', 'F CON S F BLA - BUL/EC', 'F CON H', 'F CON S F ANK - BLA', 'F CON S F BLA - ANK', 'F CON S A SEV - BUL', 'F CON S A GRE - BUL', 'F CON - BLA', 'F CON S A RUM - ANK', 'F CON - SMY', 'F CON S F ANK', 'F CON S A SEV - ANK', 'F CON - ANK', 'F CON S F BLA', 'F CON S A RUM - BUL', 'F CON S F BLA - BUL'], 'SEV': ['A SEV - ANK VIA', 'A SEV S A RUM - UKR', 'A SEV S A BUL - RUM', 'A SEV S A GAL - RUM', 'A SEV - BUL VIA', 'A SEV H', 'A SEV S A RUM - ARM', 'A SEV - UKR', 'A SEV - MOS', 'A SEV S A BUD - RUM', 'A SEV - ARM', 'A SEV S A RUM', 'A SEV S F BLA - ARM', 'A SEV S F BLA - RUM', 'A SEV - RUM', 'A SEV S A GAL - UKR', 'A SEV S F ANK - ARM', 'A SEV S A BUL - ARM', 'A SEV - RUM VIA', 'A SEV - ARM VIA', 'A SEV - CON VIA']}}\n</possible_orders>\n\n### **Your Objective:**\n\nYour ultimate goal is absolute domination\u2014seize every supply center and crush your opposition to win!

Unit Analysis and Potential Moves:\n\nFor ITALY:\n   - F ALB: Potential moves to ION, GRE, or support other units\n   - A GRE: Potential moves to SER, BUL, or convoy opportunities\n   - F TYS: Potential moves to NAP, ROM, or support naval operations\n\nFor TURKEY:\n   - F ANK: Can move to BLA, ARM, or CON\n   - F BLA: Multiple convoy and movement options\n   - F CON: Can move to AEG, BLA, or support other units\n   - A SEV: Can move to RUM, ARM, or MOS\n\n4. Strategic Considerations:\n   - We want to create pressure on RUSSIA's southern regions\n   - Potential convoy of A SEV to RUM or ARM\n   - Support movements that destabilize AUSTRIA or RUSSIA\n\n5. Proposed Strategy:\n\nFor ITALY:\n   - F ALB will support A GRE moving to SER\n   - A GRE will move to SER\n   - F TYS will support potential convoy or move to protect our interests\n\nFor TURKEY:\n   - F ANK supports F BLA moving to CON\n   - F BLA moves to CON\n   - A SEV prepares to move to RUM\n\n6. Detailed Analysis Verification:\n   - Checked adjacent regions \u2713\n   - Verified no moves into own regions \u2713\n   - Ensured potential support for moves \u2713\n\nHere's the JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"F1909M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Strategic expansion in Balkans, pressuring RUSSIA and AUSTRIA\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"ALB\", \"GRE\", \"TYS\", \"ANK\", \"BLA\", \"CON\", \"SEV\"],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"F ALB\", \"A GRE\", \"F TYS\", \"F ANK\", \"F BLA\", \"F CON\", \"A SEV\"],\n    \"adjacent\": [\n        {\"ALB\": [\"ADR\", \"GRE\", \"ION\", \"SER\", \"TRI\"]},\n        {\"GRE\": [\"AEG\", \"ALB\", \"BUL/SC\", \"ION\", \"SER\"]},\n        {\"ANK\": [\"ARM\", \"BLA\", \"CON\"]},\n        {\"BLA\": [\"ANK\", \"ARM\", \"BUL/EC\", \"CON\", \"RUM\", \"SEV\"]},\n        {\"CON\": [\"AEG\", \"BUL/EC\", \"BUL/SC\", \"BLA\", \"ANK\"]}\n    ],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"VIE\", \"SMY\", \"GRE\", \"BUD\", \"RUM\"],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    \"attackable\": [\"SER\", \"RUM\"],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [\n        {\"SER\": 1},\n        {\"RUM\": 2}\n    ],\n    \"support_given\": [\n        {\"supporter\": \"F ALB\", \"supported\": \"A GRE\", \"target\": \"SER\"},\n        {\"supporter\": \"F ANK\", \"supported\": \"F BLA\", \"target\": \"CON\"}\n    ],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"ITALY\": [0, 1, 0],\n        \"TURKEY\": [0, 1, 0, 0]\n    },\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"ITALY\": [\n            \"F ALB S A GRE - SER\",\n            \"A GRE - SER\",\n            \"F TYS H\"\n        ],\n        \"TURKEY\": [\n            \"F ANK S F BLA - CON\",\n            \"F BLA - CON\",\n            \"A SEV - RUM\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis strategy aims to:\n1. Expand into SER for ITALY\n2. Move towards CON for TURKEY\n3. Prepare potential future moves into RUM\n4. Maintain defensive positions\n5. Create pressure on neighboring powers\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the strategy?"

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

          "content": "\nYou are playing a game of Diplomacy against 6 opponents. Diplomacy is a 7-player turn based game, where players must use negotiation and strategy to control the most supply centers on the map. The players can move their units to different locations on the map, and can support other players' units to help them succeed. The game is played on a map of Europe, divided into territories and sea zones. The players can issue orders to their units to move, support, hold, or convoy. The game ends when one player controls 18 supply centers.\n\n34 of the land provinces are supply centers. Possession of these supply centers allows the powers who control them to raise and maintain armies and fleets. As they are also a central part of the game's victory conditions, they are the focus of much of the game's activity.\n\nEach player is given three (save for Russia, which has four) home supply centers. These spaces are the starting point for their owning power's initial forces. The players can then build new units at these home supply centers as they capture further supply centers. New units can only be built on a power's home supply centers. If a power loses all of its home supply centers it may continue to play; however, it may not build new units until it has recaptured at least one of its home supply centers.\n\nIn Diplomacy, there are two types of units: Armies and Fleets. An army can travel in land spaces and coastal land spaces, and a fleet can travel in sea spaces and coastal land spaces.\n\nAll units in Diplomacy move only one space at a time and only one unit may occupy any space at any time. The exception to this rule comes in the form of a successful convoy, where a convoyed army may travel multiple spaces depending on the length of the chain created by the convoying fleets. A convoyed army must embark from a coastal land province and land at a coastal land province.\n\nDiplomacy proceeds by seasons, beginning in the year 1901, with each year divided into two main seasons: the \"Spring\" and \"Fall\" (Autumn) moves. Each season is further divided into negotiation and movement phases, followed by \"retreat\" or \"disband\" adjustments and an end-of-the-year Winter phase of new builds or removals following the Fall adjustments.\n                                  \nNegotiation phase\n\nIn the negotiation phase, players discuss tactics and strategy, form alliances, and share intelligence or spread disinformation. Negotiations may be made public or kept private. Players are not bound to anything they say or promise, and no agreements are enforceable.\nCommunication and trust are highly important; players must forge alliances with others and observe their actions to evaluate their trustworthiness. At the same time, they must convince others of their own trustworthiness while making plans to turn against their allies when least expected. A well-timed betrayal can be just as profitable as an enduring, reliable alliance.\n\nMovement phase\n\nAfter the negotiation period, players write secret orders for each unit; these orders are revealed and executed simultaneously. A unit can move from its location to an adjacent space, support an adjacent unit to hold an area in the event of an attack, support another unit to attack a space into which it could move itself, or hold defensively. In addition, fleets may transport armies from one coast space to another when in a chain called a \"convoy\". Armies may only occupy land regions, and fleets occupy sea regions and the land regions that border named seas. Only one unit may occupy each region. If multiple units are ordered to move to the same region, only the unit with the most support moves there. If two or more units have the same highest support, a standoff occurs and no units ordered to that region move. A unit ordered to give support that is attacked has those orders canceled and is forced to hold, except in the case that support is being given to a unit invading the region from which the attack originated (in which case the unit that had been ordered to give support must retreat from, rather than hold, its position).\nCertain spaces on the board have two coasts and here a player must specify which one they want their fleet to occupy. A fleet can only move to coasts and oceans that border the coast that it is on. For example, a fleet occupying the southern coast of Bulgaria cannot move into Romania or the Black Sea, but a fleet on the east coast could.\n\nIn the game of Diplomacy, an action space is the collection of all the legal actions that each country or unit can take in each round. The following are common types of actions in games and their common formats:\n\n1. Attack/Move\n\nThis order moves the unit in one province to an adjacent province. Of course, armies cannot move into sea provinces, and fleets cannot move into landlocked provinces.\n\nA unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere.\n\nTwo units may not swap provinces, unless there is a convoy involved. \n\nThe format is:\n\nA [province] - [target province] (Army moves from current position to target province)\nF [province] - [target province] (Fleet moves from current position to target province)\nFor example:\n\nA BER - MUN indicates that the army from Berlin moved to Munich.\nF NTH - ENG indicates the movement of the fleet from the North Sea (NTH) to the English Channel (ENG).\n\nWhen the destination province is occupied by another unit, they do not move, unless either are attacked or defended by stronger support. When two units with equal support try to move into the same destination province, for instance:\n\nGermany\nA MUN - TYR\n\nItaly\nA VEN - TYR\n\nNeither of the two units can go into Tyrolia. Army Venice will stay in Venice, and Army Munich will stay in Munich. Again, this is assuming that these two units are the only two units in this little battle, and that they have equal support for their moves.\n\n2. Support\n\nSupport is the trickiest aspect of the rules, and the most important of the game. Support may involve cooperation between two (or more) powers, and is the only way to make forward progress through enemy territory (unless you can convince the enemy to let you in). Simply put, more support defeats less support.\n\nThe support order is given in reference to another unit's move. That other unit's move must be to a province into which the supporting unit could otherwise move. Support may also be given to a unit holding its position. In addition, units giving support can themselves be supported in their holding position.\n\nSupport is a unit's sole action for a given move, and supporting units remain where they are (unless they are attacked by greater support and have to retreat or disband during the retreat phase).\n\nA country cannot dislodge or support the dislodgement of one of its own units, although if same country's units attempt to move into the same province with equal support, neither will succeed as normal.\n\nCutting Support: If the supporting unit is attacked during the turn by some other unit, its support is cut. In effect, the support order becomes a hold order, as the unit must defend its province against the attack. Note that a unit occupying the province into which the support is directed cannot cut support, unless its attack successfully dislodges the supporting unit. An attack by a country on one of its own units also doesn't cut support.\n\nThe format is:\n\nA [province] S A [target province] - [destination] (support army movement)\nA [province] S A [target province] (supporting the garrisoning of the army)\nF [province] S F [target province] - [destination] (Support fleet movement)\nF [province] S F [target province] (garrisoning of supporting fleet)\nFor example:\n\nA BER S A MUN indicated that the Army in Berlin supported the Army garrison in Munich.\nA BER S A MUN-KIE stated that the Army of Berlin supported the Army of Munich in moving to Kiel.\n\nOther example:\n\nNB: Below are complete orders as submitted by all 7 Powers for the Fall 1907 campaign season of a made-up game to help you understand the intricacies of supporting and breaking support. Having a game map to look on with is highly recommended; the one provided at the top of this page is adequate.\n\n\nWe'll start with:\n\n--Germany--\nArmy Ruhr to Holland\nFleet Kiel supports Army Ruhr to Holland\nArmy Munich supports Army Ruhr to Holland\nNote that in this case the order for Munich to support Ruhr into Holland would not work because Munich does not border Holland and thus cannot support Ruhr in (Munich could, however, support Ruhr if Ruhr were simply holding). The rule for supporting an attack is that a supporting unit must border the province being attacked, but need not border the attacker's province of origin (to support a unit to hold, however, the supporting unit must border the supported unit). Essentially, the supporting unit must border the destination of the supported unit, whether it is its own province or a new province entirely. In sum, Ruhr is actually attacking Holland with the support of only one unit (Fleet Kiel).\n\nArmy Prussia supports Army Silesia\nArmy Silesia supports Army Prussia\nHere, Army Prussia is supported by one unit, and Army Silesia is supported by one unit. The last two moves are legal, and this method of double-support is helpful when there are two units that both could be attacked and dislodged. Of course, if both units are attacked, the support fails.\n\n\n--England--\nArmy London to Holland\nFleet North Sea convoys Army London to Holland (<-- a convoy)\nFleet Heligoland Bight supports Army London to Holland\nNote that the convoying fleet is not considered to be giving support, so Army London actually has support from only one unit: Fleet Heligoland-Bight.\n\nArmy Denmark to Kiel\nHere England interferes with Germany's plans (see Germany, above) by attacking Kiel with Army Denmark. This cuts the support of Fleet Kiel to Army Ruhr, thereby leaving Army Ruhr's attack on Holland unsupported.\n\nArmy London, on the other hand, (see above) is supported in its attack on Holland by one unit (Fleet Heligoland-Bight), thereby enabling Army London to be convoyed successfully into Holland, as long as Fleet North Sea is not dislodged during the convoy.\n\nArmy Picardy to Brest\nFleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean supports Army Picardy to Brest\nFleet English Channel supports Army Picardy to Brest\nHere Army Picardy is supported by both Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean and Fleet English Channel to move into Brest. Unless the French successfully defend it, England will also take Brest.\n\n\n--France--\n\nFleet Gascony to Mid-Atlantic Ocean\nFleet Irish Sea to English Channel\nFleet Gascony and Fleet Irish Sea cut the support by Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean and Fleet English Channel for England's Army Picardy (see England, above). Therefore, Army Picardy is now attacking Brest unsupported.\n\nFleet Brest holds\nArmy Paris supports Fleet Brest\nArmy Paris supports Fleet Brest, and so Army Picardy\u2019s now unsupported attempt to move into Brest fails.\n\nArmy Burgundy to Ruhr\nArmy Burgundy does not successfully move into Ruhr because Army Ruhr\u2019s move to Holland failed (see Germany and England, above).\n\n\n--Russia--\n\nFleet Sevastopol holds\nArmy Moscow supports Fleet Sevastopol\n\nFleet Sevastopol is supported by Army Moscow.\n\nFleet St. Petersburg (North Coast) to Norway\nArmy Finland supports Fleet St. Petersburg (North Coast) to Norway\n\nNorway is not occupied, so Russia takes it immediately.\n\nArmy Livonia to Prussia\n\nUnsupported Army Livonia attempts to move into Prussia, but since Army Prussia is supported by Army Silesia (see Germany, above), the attack is not successful.\n\n\n--Austria-Hungary--\n\nArmy Ukraine supports Fleet Sevastopol\n\nArmy Ukraine supports Fleet Sevastopol, so there are now two units supporting (see Russia, above). In fact, international support is necessary in alliances, whether supporting each other in defence or to attack another Power.\n\nFleet Trieste holds\nArmy Budapest supports Fleet Trieste\nArmy Vienna supports Fleet Trieste\n\nThere are two units supporting Fleet Trieste: Army Budapest and Army Vienna.\n\n\n--Turkey--\n\nArmy Galicia to Ukraine\n\nArmy Galicia cuts the Austrian support to Sevastopol, thereby decreasing the support to Sevastopol by one unit (see Austria and Russia, above).\n\nFleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\nArmy Armenia supports Fleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\nArmy Rumania supports Fleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\n\nNow, since Fleet Black Sea is supported by two units into Sevastopol, Fleet Black Sea moves into Sevastopol, and Fleet Sevastopol has to be disbanded or retreat. A retreating fleet that is displaced by another force can only retreat into a movable space (i.e. a sea or coastal province that is vacant) which may not be the same space that was previously occupied by the displacing unit.\n\nSince Fleet Sevastopol has nowhere to retreat, it disbands automatically.\n\n\n--Italy--\n\nArmy Apulia to Trieste\nFleet Adriatic Sea convoys Army Apulia to Trieste\nArmy Venezia supports Army Apulia to Trieste\nFleet Albania supports Army Apulia to Trieste\n\nThere are two units supporting Army Apulia into Trieste, but since Fleet Trieste is supported by two units (see Austria-Hungary, above), the attack bounces.\n\nFinally note that the orders for both the army being convoyed and the fleet doing the convoying must use the proper protocol and fully identify the units involved in the convoy. This is a complex manoeuver and becomes more complex if it involves units controlled by more than one power.\n\n3. Hold\nThis is the default for all units (what they will do if not given any other orders). The unit will stay in its position, and will not move, support, convoy, or do anything. Holding units can be supported by units in neighboring provinces or be attacked by foreign units. If the attacking unit has more units supporting it than the holding unit, the holding unit is ousted from that province and must either retreat or disband. The format is:\n\nA [province] H (Army garrison)\nF [province] H (Fleet garrison)\nFor example:\n\nA BER H means the Army garrison in Berlin.\n\n4. Convoy (Occupation)\n\nThis move is used to transfer army units across sea spaces, or to move large distances in one move. Only armies may be convoyed, and only fleets may convoy.\n\nThe fleet may choose to transport an army from one coastal province to another. The operation requires the collaboration of multiple fleets, especially over long distances. The format is:\n\nF [province] C A [origin province] - [destination province]\nFor example:\n\nF ENG C A LON-BRE refers to the fleet in the English Channel transporting the Army of London to Brest (BRE).\n\nA convoy order would be:\n\n--England--\nA YOR - NOR\nFleet North Sea convoys Army Yorkshire to Norway\n\nArmy Yorkshire will move to Norway, unless another unit should prevent this process by dislodging or destroying the convoying fleet. If a convoy order fails and the convoyed piece could not ordinarily move there without the convoy, the convoyed army unit holds.\n\nThe unit being convoyed can be supported into its destination space by any other units that border the destination space, just like any other support. However, if the convoying fleet is dislodged, it cannot convoy the unit and the entire move will fail. Note that convoys are not \"broken\" as easily as support; a convoying fleet that is attacked but not dislodged will successfully carry out its convoy order.\n\nConvoying fleets can be supported to prevent them from being dislodged or destroyed. Convoying fleets cannot perform any other order.\n\nA fleet on a coastal space may not convoy.\n\nIf an army can arrive to its destination either by land or convoy, convoy is used if at least one of the convoying fleets belongs to the army's owner, or if army's owner specified \"via convoy\" on the army's move order; otherwise, land route is used.\n\nIf several fleets are convoying an army so that it can take multiple routes to its destination, convoy succeeds as long as at least one convoy route remains open.\n\n5. Build\nDuring the specified construction phase of the game, the country in control can choose to build new units (army or fleet) in the supply center, provided that there are supply centers available and it does not exceed its maximum number of supply centers.\n\nFor example:\n\nBuild A BER means to build a new army in Berlin.\n\n6. Disband\nUnits may choose to disband, usually when defeated or strategically necessary.\n\nSyntax:\n\n// Comments\n// -----------------------------\n// Order Syntax\n// -----------------------------\n// *** Recommended syntax **\nA LON H\nF IRI - MAO\nA IRI - MAO VIA\nA WAL S F LON\nA WAL S F MAO - IRI\nF NWG C A NWY - EDI\nA IRO R MAO\nA IRO D\nA LON B\nF LIV B\n\n// Support\nA WAL S F LON\nWAL S LON\nA WAL S LON\nF WAL S F MAO - IRI\n\n// Convoy\nF NWG C A NWY - EDI\nNWG C NWY - EDI\n\n// Retreat (Retreat Phase)\nA IRO R MAO\nRETREAT IRO - MAO\nA IRO D\nRETREAT IRO DISBAND\n\n// Build\nA LON B\nF LIV B\nBUILD A LON\nBUILD F LIV\n\n// Remove\nF LIV D\nREMOVE F LIV\nDISBAND F LIV\n\n// Waive\nWAIVE\n\nThe range of action space per turn\nAt each turn, players can choose a combination of actions to perform on the units they control, which can be moves, supports, garrisons, capture, etc.\n                                  \nEnd-of-year and supply centers\nAfter each Fall move, newly acquired supply centers become owned by the occupying player, and each power's supply center total is recalculated; players with fewer supply centers than units on the board must disband units, while players with more supply centers than units on the board are entitled to build units in their open (unoccupied) Home centers (supply centers controlled at the start of the game). Players who have lost all of their Home centers may not build new units, while players controlling no supply centers are eliminated from the game. If a player controls 18 or more (being more than half) of the 34 supply centers at the end of a year, they are the winner. Players who remain may also agree to a draw \u2013 around half of all games will end in a draw.\n\nYou are playing as []. The other players are playing as the following powers: AUSTRIA, ENGLAND, FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, RUSSIA, TURKEY. There are no neutral powers in this game. The action space is the set of possible orders that you can issue to your units. You can issue orders to move your units to different locations, support other players' units, hold your units in place, or convoy your units across sea zones.\n"

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"step_by_step_reasoning\": \"Your step by step reasoning here\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **step_by_step_reasoning:**\n     - Provide your above step by step reasoning details in the \"step_by_step_reasoning\" field.\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>\n     - Example: `[{\"MUN\": [\"TYR\", \"BOH\"]}, ...]`\n\n   - **other_power_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**\n     - A list of integers (0 or 1).\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list.\n     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)\n     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.\n     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`\n\n   - **attackable:**\n     - A list of locations.\n     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.\n     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'GERMANY': {'BEL': ['A BEL -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>\n     - Example: `[{\"MUN\": [\"TYR\", \"BOH\"]}, ...]`\n\n   - **other_power_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**\n     - A list of integers (0 or 1).\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list.\n     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region.

You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'GERMANY': {'BAL': ['F BAL S A MUN - KIE', 'F BAL S F SWE', 'F BAL S F SWE - BOT', 'F BAL S A MUN - BER', 'F BAL H', 'F BAL S F HEL - KIE', 'F BAL - LVN', 'F BAL - BOT', 'F BAL S F HEL - DEN', 'F BAL - KIE', 'F BAL S F SWE - DEN', 'F BAL - PRU', 'F BAL S F NWY - SWE', 'F BAL S A RUH - KIE', 'F BAL - BER', 'F BAL - DEN', 'F BAL - SWE'], 'BUR': ['A BUR - RUH', 'A BUR S F BRE - PIC', 'A BUR - MUN', 'A BUR S A PAR - PIC', 'A BUR - BEL', 'A BUR S A MAR', 'A BUR H', 'A BUR S A PIC - BEL', 'A BUR - PIC', 'A BUR S A PAR', 'A BUR S A PIE - MAR', 'A BUR S A RUH - MUN', 'A BUR - GAS', 'A BUR S A SPA - MAR', 'A BUR S A WAL - BEL', 'A BUR S A MAR - GAS', 'A BUR S A RUH', 'A BUR S A PAR - GAS', 'A BUR S A WAL - PIC', 'A BUR - PAR', 'A BUR S A RUH - BEL', 'A BUR S F ENG - PIC', 'A BUR S A PIC - PAR', 'A BUR S A MUN - RUH', 'A BUR S F BRE - GAS', 'A BUR S F ENG - BEL', 'A BUR S A MUN', 'A BUR - MAR', 'A BUR S A SPA - GAS', 'A BUR S A PIC'], 'HEL': ['F HEL S F BAL - DEN', 'F HEL - KIE', 'F HEL - NTH', 'F HEL S F ENG - NTH', 'F HEL H', 'F HEL - DEN', 'F HEL S A MUN - KIE', 'F HEL S A RUH - KIE', 'F HEL S F BAL - KIE', 'F HEL - HOL', 'F HEL S F SWE - DEN', 'F HEL S F NWY - NTH', 'F HEL S A RUH - HOL'], 'MUN': ['A MUN - BUR', 'A MUN S A RUH', 'A MUN S A PIC - BUR', 'A MUN S A VEN - TYR', 'A MUN - SIL', 'A MUN S A BUR', 'A MUN - KIE', 'A MUN S A MAR - BUR', 'A MUN S F HEL - KIE', 'A MUN S A PIE - TYR', 'A MUN - TYR', 'A MUN S A RUH - KIE', 'A MUN S A RUH - BUR', 'A MUN - RUH', 'A MUN S A PAR - BUR', 'A MUN H', 'A MUN - BOH', 'A MUN S F BAL - BER', 'A MUN - BER', 'A MUN S A BUR - RUH', 'A MUN S F BAL - KIE'], 'NAO': ['F NAO S F NWY - NWG', 'F NAO S A WAL - LVP', 'F NAO S F BRE - MAO', 'F NAO - CLY', 'F NAO S F IRI - MAO', 'F NAO S A PIC - LVP', 'F NAO S F ENG - MAO', 'F NAO - IRI', 'F NAO S F IRI', 'F NAO - LVP', 'F NAO S F ENG - IRI', 'F NAO S F IRI - LVP', 'F NAO C A WAL - CLY', 'F NAO C A PIC - CLY', 'F NAO H', 'F NAO - NWG', 'F NAO - MAO'], 'NWY': ['F NWY H', 'F NWY S F ENG - NTH', 'F NWY - NWG', 'F NWY - SKA', 'F NWY - SWE', 'F NWY - BAR', 'F NWY S F BAL - SWE', 'F NWY S F HEL - NTH', 'F NWY - NTH', 'F NWY S F SWE - SKA', 'F NWY S F SWE', 'F NWY - STP/NC', 'F NWY S F NAO - NWG'], 'PIC': ['A PIC S A MUN - BUR', 'A PIC - BEL', 'A PIC S A PAR - BUR', 'A PIC S A PAR', 'A PIC S A MAR - BUR', 'A PIC H', 'A PIC - LVP VIA', 'A PIC - BRE', 'A PIC S A RUH - BUR', 'A PIC S A WAL - BEL', 'A PIC S A BUR', 'A PIC - BEL VIA', 'A PIC S F BRE', 'A PIC S F ENG - BRE', 'A PIC - BRE VIA', 'A PIC S A PAR - BRE', 'A PIC S F ENG - BEL', 'A PIC S A WAL - BRE', 'A PIC S A BUR - PAR', 'A PIC S A BUR - BEL', 'A PIC - LON VIA', 'A PIC S A RUH - BEL', 'A PIC - BUR', 'A PIC - WAL VIA', 'A PIC - CLY VIA', 'A PIC - PAR'], 'ROM': ['A ROM - NAP VIA', 'A ROM S A GRE - NAP', 'A ROM - GRE VIA', 'A ROM S A VEN', 'A ROM - TUN VIA', 'A ROM - APU', 'A ROM S A VEN - APU', 'A ROM - ALB VIA', 'A ROM S A ALB - APU', 'A ROM S F ION - NAP', 'A ROM S A VEN - TUS', 'A ROM - NAP', 'A ROM S F ION - APU', 'A ROM S A ALB - TUS', 'A ROM S A GRE - TUS', 'A ROM S A PIE - TUS', 'A ROM S F TYS - NAP', 'A ROM S A ALB - NAP', 'A ROM H', 'A ROM - TUS', 'A ROM S F TYS - TUS', 'A ROM S A GRE - APU', 'A ROM S A PIE - VEN', 'A ROM - VEN', 'A ROM - TUS VIA', 'A ROM - APU VIA'], 'RUH': ['A RUH S F BAL - KIE', 'A RUH S A MAR - BUR', 'A RUH - HOL', 'A RUH S F HEL - HOL', 'A RUH H', 'A RUH S F HEL - KIE', 'A RUH S A PIC - BUR', 'A RUH S A BUR - BEL', 'A RUH S A PIC - BEL', 'A RUH S A WAL - BEL', 'A RUH S A MUN - KIE', 'A RUH S A MUN - BUR', 'A RUH S A BUR - MUN', 'A RUH - BEL', 'A RUH S A MUN', 'A RUH S F ENG - BEL', 'A RUH S A BUR', 'A RUH S A PAR - BUR', 'A RUH - MUN', 'A RUH - KIE', 'A RUH - BUR']}}\n</possible_orders>\n\n### **Your Objective:**\n\nYour ultimate goal is absolute domination\u2014seize every supply center and crush your opposition to win!

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>\n     - Example: `[{\"MUN\": [\"TYR\", \"BOH\"]}, ...]`\n\n   - **other_power_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**\n     - A list of integers (0 or 1).\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list.\n     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)\n     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.\n     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`\n\n   - **attackable:**\n     - A list of locations.\n     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.\n     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'GERMANY': {'HEL': ['F HEL H', 'F HEL S F SWE - DEN', 'F HEL - NTH', 'F HEL - KIE', 'F HEL S A KIE', 'F HEL S A KIE - HOL', 'F HEL S A MUN - KIE', 'F HEL - HOL', 'F HEL C A KIE - DEN', 'F HEL S F NWY - NTH', 'F HEL C A KIE - HOL', 'F HEL S F SKA - DEN', 'F HEL S A KIE - DEN', 'F HEL S A RUH - HOL', 'F HEL S A RUH - KIE', 'F HEL S F SKA - NTH', 'F HEL - DEN'], 'KIE': ['A KIE - DEN', 'A KIE S A MUN - RUH', 'A KIE S A RUH - HOL', 'A KIE - RUH', 'A KIE - MUN', 'A KIE S A MUN', 'A KIE S A BUR - MUN', 'A KIE S F HEL - DEN', 'A KIE - HOL', 'A KIE S A BUR - RUH', 'A KIE S A RUH - MUN', 'A KIE - DEN VIA', 'A KIE - BER', 'A KIE H', 'A KIE S A RUH', 'A KIE S F SKA - DEN', 'A KIE S F SWE - DEN', 'A KIE - HOL VIA', 'A KIE S A MUN - BER', 'A KIE S F HEL - HOL'], 'LVP': ['F LVP - WAL', 'F LVP S F IRI', 'F LVP H', 'F LVP - CLY', 'F LVP - IRI', 'F LVP S F IRI - WAL', 'F LVP - NAO', 'F LVP S A LON - WAL', 'F LVP S F IRI - NAO'], 'MUN': ['A MUN S A PIE - TYR', 'A MUN S A PAR - BUR', 'A MUN S A RUH - KIE', 'A MUN - BUR', 'A MUN - BER', 'A MUN S A TRI - TYR', 'A MUN - RUH', 'A MUN S A KIE - RUH', 'A MUN - BOH', 'A MUN - KIE', 'A MUN S A RUH', 'A MUN S F HEL - KIE', 'A MUN - TYR', 'A MUN S A BUR', 'A MUN S A MAR - BUR', 'A MUN S A RUH - BUR', 'A MUN S A BUR - RUH', 'A MUN - SIL', 'A MUN H', 'A MUN S A GAS - BUR', 'A MUN S A KIE - BER', 'A MUN S A KIE'], 'NWY': ['F NWY S F SWE', 'F NWY - BAR', 'F NWY - STP/NC', 'F NWY - NWG', 'F NWY S F SKA - NTH', 'F NWY - SKA', 'F NWY S F SKA', 'F NWY - NTH', 'F NWY S F HEL - NTH', 'F NWY S F SWE - SKA', 'F NWY S F SKA - SWE', 'F NWY H', 'F NWY - SWE'], 'PAR': ['A PAR S F BRE - PIC', 'A PAR S A MAR - GAS', 'A PAR S F BRE - GAS', 'A PAR - BRE', 'A PAR S A GAS - BRE', 'A PAR S A MUN - BUR', 'A PAR S F PIC - BRE', 'A PAR S A BUR - PIC', 'A PAR S A BUR', 'A PAR S A GAS', 'A PAR S A BUR - GAS', 'A PAR S A MAR - BUR', 'A PAR S A GAS - BUR', 'A PAR - PIC', 'A PAR S F PIC', 'A PAR - GAS', 'A PAR H', 'A PAR S F BRE', 'A PAR S A RUH - BUR', 'A PAR - BUR'], 'RUH': ['A RUH - BUR', 'A RUH S A KIE', 'A RUH - HOL', 'A RUH - MUN', 'A RUH S A MUN - KIE', 'A RUH S A BUR', 'A RUH S A MUN', 'A RUH S A MAR - BUR', 'A RUH S A PAR - BUR', 'A RUH S F PIC - BEL', 'A RUH S A BUR - BEL', 'A RUH H', 'A RUH S F HEL - KIE', 'A RUH S A MUN - BUR', 'A RUH S F HEL - HOL', 'A RUH S A KIE - MUN', 'A RUH S A KIE - HOL', 'A RUH - BEL', 'A RUH S A BUR - MUN', 'A RUH S A GAS - BUR', 'A RUH - KIE'], 'SWE': ['F SWE H', 'F SWE S F NWY', 'F SWE - FIN', 'F SWE S A KIE - DEN', 'F SWE S F SKA', 'F SWE - DEN', 'F SWE - BAL', 'F SWE S F HEL - DEN', 'F SWE S F SKA - NWY', 'F SWE S F SKA - DEN', 'F SWE - NWY', 'F SWE - BOT', 'F SWE S F NWY - SKA', 'F SWE - SKA'], 'TUS': ['A TUS S A BUL - ROM', 'A TUS S A PIE - VEN', 'A TUS - VEN', 'A TUS - ROM', 'A TUS H', 'A TUS S A MAR - PIE', 'A TUS - ROM VIA', 'A TUS - BUL VIA', 'A TUS S A PIE', 'A TUS - PIE', 'A TUS S A GRE - ROM', 'A TUS - GRE VIA', 'A TUS S A ALB - ROM', 'A TUS S A TRI - VEN', 'A TUS - NAP VIA', 'A TUS S F TYS - ROM', 'A TUS - TUN VIA', 'A TUS - SMY VIA', 'A TUS - APU VIA', 'A TUS - CON VIA', 'A TUS - ALB VIA']}}\n</possible_orders>\n\n### **Your Objective:**\n\nYour ultimate goal is absolute domination\u2014seize every supply center and crush your opposition to win!

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>\n     - Example: `[{\"MUN\": [\"TYR\", \"BOH\"]}, ...]`\n\n   - **other_power_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**\n     - A list of integers (0 or 1).\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list.\n     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)\n     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.\n     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`\n\n   - **attackable:**\n     - A list of locations.\n     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.\n     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'GERMANY': {'BAL': ['F BAL S A BER -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>\n     - Example: `[{\"MUN\": [\"TYR\", \"BOH\"]}, ...]`\n\n   - **other_power_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**\n     - A list of integers (0 or 1).\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list.\n     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)\n     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.\n     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`\n\n   - **attackable:**\n     - A list of locations.\n     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.\n     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'GERMANY': {'BAL': ['F BAL S F SKA -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>\n     - Example: `[{\"MUN\": [\"TYR\", \"BOH\"]}, ...]`\n\n   - **other_power_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**\n     - A list of integers (0 or 1).\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list.\n     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)\n     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.\n     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`\n\n   - **attackable:**\n     - A list of locations.\n     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.\n     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'GERMANY': {'BAL': ['F BAL -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>\n     - Example: `[{\"MUN\": [\"TYR\", \"BOH\"]}, ...]`\n\n   - **other_power_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**\n     - A list of integers (0 or 1).\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list.\n     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)\n     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.\n     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`\n\n   - **attackable:**\n     - A list of locations.\n     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.\n     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'GERMANY': {'BER': ['F BER -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>\n     - Example: `[{\"MUN\": [\"TYR\", \"BOH\"]}, ...]`\n\n   - **other_power_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**\n     - A list of integers (0 or 1).\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list.\n     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)\n     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.\n     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`\n\n   - **attackable:**\n     - A list of locations.\n     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.\n     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'GERMANY': {'BAL': ['F BAL S A DEN -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'GERMANY': {'BAL': ['F BAL S A BER -

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>\n     - Example: `[{\"MUN\": [\"TYR\", \"BOH\"]}, ...]`\n\n   - **other_power_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**\n     - A list of integers (0 or 1).\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list.\n     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)\n     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.\n     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`\n\n   - **attackable:**\n     - A list of locations.\n     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.\n     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'GERMANY': {'BER': ['A BER S A MUN', 'A BER S A PRU -

Taking Denmark helps us gain a vital supply center, and moving into Ruhr sets us up for possibilities toward Belgium or Holland later. 3) For each unit: a) F KIE -> DEN captures an unoccupied neutral supply center. b) A BER -> KIE repositions our army without conflict. c) A MUN -> RUH expands into a neutral territory, preparing for future gains. None of these moves constitute an attack on an occupied enemy province. 4) All moves are valid, adjacent, and do not move onto our own location for an 'attack.' 5) Verification: we are not attacking our own regions, the moves follow adjacency, and we do not require support since no enemy unit holds the destinations.

          "content": "\nYou are playing a game of Diplomacy against 6 opponents. Diplomacy is a 7-player turn based game, where players must use negotiation and strategy to control the most supply centers on the map. The players can move their units to different locations on the map, and can support other players' units to help them succeed. The game is played on a map of Europe, divided into territories and sea zones. The players can issue orders to their units to move, support, hold, or convoy. The game ends when one player controls 18 supply centers.\n\n34 of the land provinces are supply centers. Possession of these supply centers allows the powers who control them to raise and maintain armies and fleets. As they are also a central part of the game's victory conditions, they are the focus of much of the game's activity.\n\nEach player is given three (save for Russia, which has four) home supply centers. These spaces are the starting point for their owning power's initial forces. The players can then build new units at these home supply centers as they capture further supply centers. New units can only be built on a power's home supply centers. If a power loses all of its home supply centers it may continue to play; however, it may not build new units until it has recaptured at least one of its home supply centers.\n\nIn Diplomacy, there are two types of units: Armies and Fleets. An army can travel in land spaces and coastal land spaces, and a fleet can travel in sea spaces and coastal land spaces.\n\nAll units in Diplomacy move only one space at a time and only one unit may occupy any space at any time. The exception to this rule comes in the form of a successful convoy, where a convoyed army may travel multiple spaces depending on the length of the chain created by the convoying fleets. A convoyed army must embark from a coastal land province and land at a coastal land province.\n\nDiplomacy proceeds by seasons, beginning in the year 1901, with each year divided into two main seasons: the \"Spring\" and \"Fall\" (Autumn) moves. Each season is further divided into negotiation and movement phases, followed by \"retreat\" or \"disband\" adjustments and an end-of-the-year Winter phase of new builds or removals following the Fall adjustments.\n                                  \nNegotiation phase\n\nIn the negotiation phase, players discuss tactics and strategy, form alliances, and share intelligence or spread disinformation. Negotiations may be made public or kept private. Players are not bound to anything they say or promise, and no agreements are enforceable.\nCommunication and trust are highly important; players must forge alliances with others and observe their actions to evaluate their trustworthiness. At the same time, they must convince others of their own trustworthiness while making plans to turn against their allies when least expected. A well-timed betrayal can be just as profitable as an enduring, reliable alliance.\n\nMovement phase\n\nAfter the negotiation period, players write secret orders for each unit; these orders are revealed and executed simultaneously. A unit can move from its location to an adjacent space, support an adjacent unit to hold an area in the event of an attack, support another unit to attack a space into which it could move itself, or hold defensively. In addition, fleets may transport armies from one coast space to another when in a chain called a \"convoy\". Armies may only occupy land regions, and fleets occupy sea regions and the land regions that border named seas. Only one unit may occupy each region. If multiple units are ordered to move to the same region, only the unit with the most support moves there. If two or more units have the same highest support, a standoff occurs and no units ordered to that region move. A unit ordered to give support that is attacked has those orders canceled and is forced to hold, except in the case that support is being given to a unit invading the region from which the attack originated (in which case the unit that had been ordered to give support must retreat from, rather than hold, its position).\nCertain spaces on the board have two coasts and here a player must specify which one they want their fleet to occupy. A fleet can only move to coasts and oceans that border the coast that it is on. For example, a fleet occupying the southern coast of Bulgaria cannot move into Romania or the Black Sea, but a fleet on the east coast could.\n\nIn the game of Diplomacy, an action space is the collection of all the legal actions that each country or unit can take in each round. The following are common types of actions in games and their common formats:\n\n1. Attack/Move\n\nThis order moves the unit in one province to an adjacent province. Of course, armies cannot move into sea provinces, and fleets cannot move into landlocked provinces.\n\nA unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere.\n\nTwo units may not swap provinces, unless there is a convoy involved. \n\nThe format is:\n\nA [province] - [target province] (Army moves from current position to target province)\nF [province] - [target province] (Fleet moves from current position to target province)\nFor example:\n\nA BER - MUN indicates that the army from Berlin moved to Munich.\nF NTH - ENG indicates the movement of the fleet from the North Sea (NTH) to the English Channel (ENG).\n\nWhen the destination province is occupied by another unit, they do not move, unless either are attacked or defended by stronger support. When two units with equal support try to move into the same destination province, for instance:\n\nGermany\nA MUN - TYR\n\nItaly\nA VEN - TYR\n\nNeither of the two units can go into Tyrolia. Army Venice will stay in Venice, and Army Munich will stay in Munich. Again, this is assuming that these two units are the only two units in this little battle, and that they have equal support for their moves.\n\n2. Support\n\nSupport is the trickiest aspect of the rules, and the most important of the game. Support may involve cooperation between two (or more) powers, and is the only way to make forward progress through enemy territory (unless you can convince the enemy to let you in). Simply put, more support defeats less support.\n\nThe support order is given in reference to another unit's move. That other unit's move must be to a province into which the supporting unit could otherwise move. Support may also be given to a unit holding its position. In addition, units giving support can themselves be supported in their holding position.\n\nSupport is a unit's sole action for a given move, and supporting units remain where they are (unless they are attacked by greater support and have to retreat or disband during the retreat phase).\n\nA country cannot dislodge or support the dislodgement of one of its own units, although if same country's units attempt to move into the same province with equal support, neither will succeed as normal.\n\nCutting Support: If the supporting unit is attacked during the turn by some other unit, its support is cut. In effect, the support order becomes a hold order, as the unit must defend its province against the attack. Note that a unit occupying the province into which the support is directed cannot cut support, unless its attack successfully dislodges the supporting unit. An attack by a country on one of its own units also doesn't cut support.\n\nThe format is:\n\nA [province] S A [target province] - [destination] (support army movement)\nA [province] S A [target province] (supporting the garrisoning of the army)\nF [province] S F [target province] - [destination] (Support fleet movement)\nF [province] S F [target province] (garrisoning of supporting fleet)\nFor example:\n\nA BER S A MUN indicated that the Army in Berlin supported the Army garrison in Munich.\nA BER S A MUN-KIE stated that the Army of Berlin supported the Army of Munich in moving to Kiel.\n\nOther example:\n\nNB: Below are complete orders as submitted by all 7 Powers for the Fall 1907 campaign season of a made-up game to help you understand the intricacies of supporting and breaking support. Having a game map to look on with is highly recommended; the one provided at the top of this page is adequate.\n\n\nWe'll start with:\n\n--Germany--\nArmy Ruhr to Holland\nFleet Kiel supports Army Ruhr to Holland\nArmy Munich supports Army Ruhr to Holland\nNote that in this case the order for Munich to support Ruhr into Holland would not work because Munich does not border Holland and thus cannot support Ruhr in (Munich could, however, support Ruhr if Ruhr were simply holding). The rule for supporting an attack is that a supporting unit must border the province being attacked, but need not border the attacker's province of origin (to support a unit to hold, however, the supporting unit must border the supported unit). Essentially, the supporting unit must border the destination of the supported unit, whether it is its own province or a new province entirely. In sum, Ruhr is actually attacking Holland with the support of only one unit (Fleet Kiel).\n\nArmy Prussia supports Army Silesia\nArmy Silesia supports Army Prussia\nHere, Army Prussia is supported by one unit, and Army Silesia is supported by one unit. The last two moves are legal, and this method of double-support is helpful when there are two units that both could be attacked and dislodged. Of course, if both units are attacked, the support fails.\n\n\n--England--\nArmy London to Holland\nFleet North Sea convoys Army London to Holland (<-- a convoy)\nFleet Heligoland Bight supports Army London to Holland\nNote that the convoying fleet is not considered to be giving support, so Army London actually has support from only one unit: Fleet Heligoland-Bight.\n\nArmy Denmark to Kiel\nHere England interferes with Germany's plans (see Germany, above) by attacking Kiel with Army Denmark. This cuts the support of Fleet Kiel to Army Ruhr, thereby leaving Army Ruhr's attack on Holland unsupported.\n\nArmy London, on the other hand, (see above) is supported in its attack on Holland by one unit (Fleet Heligoland-Bight), thereby enabling Army London to be convoyed successfully into Holland, as long as Fleet North Sea is not dislodged during the convoy.\n\nArmy Picardy to Brest\nFleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean supports Army Picardy to Brest\nFleet English Channel supports Army Picardy to Brest\nHere Army Picardy is supported by both Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean and Fleet English Channel to move into Brest. Unless the French successfully defend it, England will also take Brest.\n\n\n--France--\n\nFleet Gascony to Mid-Atlantic Ocean\nFleet Irish Sea to English Channel\nFleet Gascony and Fleet Irish Sea cut the support by Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean and Fleet English Channel for England's Army Picardy (see England, above). Therefore, Army Picardy is now attacking Brest unsupported.\n\nFleet Brest holds\nArmy Paris supports Fleet Brest\nArmy Paris supports Fleet Brest, and so Army Picardy\u2019s now unsupported attempt to move into Brest fails.\n\nArmy Burgundy to Ruhr\nArmy Burgundy does not successfully move into Ruhr because Army Ruhr\u2019s move to Holland failed (see Germany and England, above).\n\n\n--Russia--\n\nFleet Sevastopol holds\nArmy Moscow supports Fleet Sevastopol\n\nFleet Sevastopol is supported by Army Moscow.\n\nFleet St. Petersburg (North Coast) to Norway\nArmy Finland supports Fleet St. Petersburg (North Coast) to Norway\n\nNorway is not occupied, so Russia takes it immediately.\n\nArmy Livonia to Prussia\n\nUnsupported Army Livonia attempts to move into Prussia, but since Army Prussia is supported by Army Silesia (see Germany, above), the attack is not successful.\n\n\n--Austria-Hungary--\n\nArmy Ukraine supports Fleet Sevastopol\n\nArmy Ukraine supports Fleet Sevastopol, so there are now two units supporting (see Russia, above). In fact, international support is necessary in alliances, whether supporting each other in defence or to attack another Power.\n\nFleet Trieste holds\nArmy Budapest supports Fleet Trieste\nArmy Vienna supports Fleet Trieste\n\nThere are two units supporting Fleet Trieste: Army Budapest and Army Vienna.\n\n\n--Turkey--\n\nArmy Galicia to Ukraine\n\nArmy Galicia cuts the Austrian support to Sevastopol, thereby decreasing the support to Sevastopol by one unit (see Austria and Russia, above).\n\nFleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\nArmy Armenia supports Fleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\nArmy Rumania supports Fleet Black Sea to Sevastopol\n\nNow, since Fleet Black Sea is supported by two units into Sevastopol, Fleet Black Sea moves into Sevastopol, and Fleet Sevastopol has to be disbanded or retreat. A retreating fleet that is displaced by another force can only retreat into a movable space (i.e. a sea or coastal province that is vacant) which may not be the same space that was previously occupied by the displacing unit.\n\nSince Fleet Sevastopol has nowhere to retreat, it disbands automatically.\n\n\n--Italy--\n\nArmy Apulia to Trieste\nFleet Adriatic Sea convoys Army Apulia to Trieste\nArmy Venezia supports Army Apulia to Trieste\nFleet Albania supports Army Apulia to Trieste\n\nThere are two units supporting Army Apulia into Trieste, but since Fleet Trieste is supported by two units (see Austria-Hungary, above), the attack bounces.\n\nFinally note that the orders for both the army being convoyed and the fleet doing the convoying must use the proper protocol and fully identify the units involved in the convoy. This is a complex manoeuver and becomes more complex if it involves units controlled by more than one power.\n\n3. Hold\nThis is the default for all units (what they will do if not given any other orders). The unit will stay in its position, and will not move, support, convoy, or do anything. Holding units can be supported by units in neighboring provinces or be attacked by foreign units. If the attacking unit has more units supporting it than the holding unit, the holding unit is ousted from that province and must either retreat or disband. The format is:\n\nA [province] H (Army garrison)\nF [province] H (Fleet garrison)\nFor example:\n\nA BER H means the Army garrison in Berlin.\n\n4. Convoy (Occupation)\n\nThis move is used to transfer army units across sea spaces, or to move large distances in one move. Only armies may be convoyed, and only fleets may convoy.\n\nThe fleet may choose to transport an army from one coastal province to another. The operation requires the collaboration of multiple fleets, especially over long distances. The format is:\n\nF [province] C A [origin province] - [destination province]\nFor example:\n\nF ENG C A LON-BRE refers to the fleet in the English Channel transporting the Army of London to Brest (BRE).\n\nA convoy order would be:\n\n--England--\nA YOR - NOR\nFleet North Sea convoys Army Yorkshire to Norway\n\nArmy Yorkshire will move to Norway, unless another unit should prevent this process by dislodging or destroying the convoying fleet. If a convoy order fails and the convoyed piece could not ordinarily move there without the convoy, the convoyed army unit holds.\n\nThe unit being convoyed can be supported into its destination space by any other units that border the destination space, just like any other support. However, if the convoying fleet is dislodged, it cannot convoy the unit and the entire move will fail. Note that convoys are not \"broken\" as easily as support; a convoying fleet that is attacked but not dislodged will successfully carry out its convoy order.\n\nConvoying fleets can be supported to prevent them from being dislodged or destroyed. Convoying fleets cannot perform any other order.\n\nA fleet on a coastal space may not convoy.\n\nIf an army can arrive to its destination either by land or convoy, convoy is used if at least one of the convoying fleets belongs to the army's owner, or if army's owner specified \"via convoy\" on the army's move order; otherwise, land route is used.\n\nIf several fleets are convoying an army so that it can take multiple routes to its destination, convoy succeeds as long as at least one convoy route remains open.\n\n5. Build\nDuring the specified construction phase of the game, the country in control can choose to build new units (army or fleet) in the supply center, provided that there are supply centers available and it does not exceed its maximum number of supply centers.\n\nFor example:\n\nBuild A BER means to build a new army in Berlin.\n\n6. Disband\nUnits may choose to disband, usually when defeated or strategically necessary.\n\nSyntax:\n\n// Comments\n// -----------------------------\n// Order Syntax\n// -----------------------------\n// *** Recommended syntax **\nA LON H\nF IRI - MAO\nA IRI - MAO VIA\nA WAL S F LON\nA WAL S F MAO - IRI\nF NWG C A NWY - EDI\nA IRO R MAO\nA IRO D\nA LON B\nF LIV B\n\n// Support\nA WAL S F LON\nWAL S LON\nA WAL S LON\nF WAL S F MAO - IRI\n\n// Convoy\nF NWG C A NWY - EDI\nNWG C NWY - EDI\n\n// Retreat (Retreat Phase)\nA IRO R MAO\nRETREAT IRO - MAO\nA IRO D\nRETREAT IRO DISBAND\n\n// Build\nA LON B\nF LIV B\nBUILD A LON\nBUILD F LIV\n\n// Remove\nF LIV D\nREMOVE F LIV\nDISBAND F LIV\n\n// Waive\nWAIVE\n\nThe range of action space per turn\nAt each turn, players can choose a combination of actions to perform on the units they control, which can be moves, supports, garrisons, capture, etc.\n                                  \nEnd-of-year and supply centers\nAfter each Fall move, newly acquired supply centers become owned by the occupying player, and each power's supply center total is recalculated; players with fewer supply centers than units on the board must disband units, while players with more supply centers than units on the board are entitled to build units in their open (unoccupied) Home centers (supply centers controlled at the start of the game). Players who have lost all of their Home centers may not build new units, while players controlling no supply centers are eliminated from the game. If a player controls 18 or more (being more than half) of the 34 supply centers at the end of a year, they are the winner. Players who remain may also agree to a draw \u2013 around half of all games will end in a draw.\n\nYou are playing as []. The other players are playing as the following powers: AUSTRIA, ENGLAND, FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, RUSSIA, TURKEY. There are no neutral powers in this game. The action space is the set of possible orders that you can issue to your units. You can issue orders to move your units to different locations, support other players' units, hold your units in place, or convoy your units across sea zones.\n"

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"step_by_step_reasoning\": \"Your step by step reasoning here\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **step_by_step_reasoning:**\n     - Provide your above step by step reasoning details in the \"step_by_step_reasoning\" field.\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

          "content": "Given the current situation as Russia in the Spring of 1901, here is a strategic plan based on the game's objectives and current state:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n**1. Analyzing Current State and Position:**\n   - **Controlled Regions:** Moscow (MOS), Sevastopol (SEV), St. Petersburg South Coast (STP/SC), Warsaw (WAR)\n   - **Units:** Army in Moscow, Fleet in Sevastopol, Fleet in St. Petersburg South Coast, Army in Warsaw.\n   - **Adjacent Regions:** \n     - Moscow (MOS): [LVN, SEV, STP, UKR, WAR]\n     - Sevastopol (SEV): [ARM, BLA, MOS, RUM, UKR]\n     - Warsaw (WAR): [GAL, LVN, MOS, PRU, SIL, UKR]\n\n**2. Objectives and Expansion Opportunities:**\n   - **Immediate Targets for Expansion:** Ukraine (UKR), Livonia (LVN), Galicia (GAL)\n   - **Reasoning:** Expanding towards Ukraine and Galicia provides a pathway towards more supply centers. Moving towards Livonia prepares for potential confrontations or alliances with Germany and opens paths to Scandinavia.\n\n**3. Detailed Order Planning:**\n   - **Moscow (MOS):**\n     - Decision: Move Army Moscow to Ukraine.\n     - Reasoning: Ukraine is a strategic point for expansion and is adjacent to Moscow.\n   - **Sevastopol (SEV):**\n     - Decision: Move Fleet Sevastopol to Rumania.\n     - Reasoning: Rumania is an uncontrolled supply center and can be easily reached from Sevastopol, allowing extra build capabilities in the next year.\n   - **St. Petersburg (STP/SC):**\n     - Decision: Move Fleet St. Petersburg South Coast to Livonia.\n     - Reasoning: Livonia connects to key strategic locations, including potential for further moves into Scandinavia or safeguarding northern territories.\n   - **Warsaw (WAR):**\n     - Decision: Move Army Warsaw to Galicia.\n     - Reasoning: Galicia is a buffer zone against Austria and can be a point of negotiation or conflict; occupying it increases strategic positioning.\n\n**4. Verification and Conflict Prediction:**\n   - **Ukraine:** Movement to Ukraine from Moscow is unlikely to face immediate resistance. It\u2019s a strategic depth expansion.\n   - **Rumania:** As Sevastopol moves to Rumania, it should be unopposed and secures a new supply center.\n   - **Livonia and Galicia:** These movements place forces near other powers, which may require subsequent diplomacy or support to maintain positions.\n\n**5. Final Orders and Diplomatic Considerations:**\n   - Continued engagement with neighboring powers, especially Turkey and Austria, to assess their movements and adjust strategies accordingly.\n   - Keeping an eye on German movements, as the proximity poses both a threat and an opportunity for alliance.\n\n### JSON Object with Orders and Reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"S1901M\",\n    \"step_by_step_reasoning\": \"Analyzing the current positions, identifying strategic expansion regions, planning detailed moves for each unit based on adjacency and likelihood of success, verifying against potential conflicts and setting final orders.\",\n    \"reason\": \"Expand territorial control efficiently into uncontrolled and strategic buffer zones (Ukraine, Rumania, Galicia, Livonia), ensuring growth in supply centers and preparing for defensive or offensive actions based on adjacent power movements.\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"MOS\", \"SEV\", \"STP\", \"WAR\"],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"MOS\", \"SEV\", \"STP/SC\", \"WAR\"],\n    \"adjacent\": [\n        {\"MOS\": [\"LVN\", \"SEV\", \"STP\", \"UKR\", \"WAR\"]},\n        {\"SEV\": [\"ARM\", \"BLA\", \"MOS\", \"RUM\", \"UKR\"]},\n        {\"WAR\": [\"GAL\", \"LVN\", \"MOS\", \"PRU\", \"SIL\", \"UKR\"]}\n    ],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"UKR\", \"RUM\", \"GAL\", \"LVN\"],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    \"attackable\": [\"UKR\", \"RUM\", \"GAL\", \"LVN\"],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [\n        {\"UKR\": 1},\n        {\"RUM\": 1},\n        {\"GAL\": 1},\n        {\"LVN\": 1}\n    ],\n    \"support_given\": [],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"RUSSIA\": [1, 1, 1, 1]\n    },\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"RUSSIA\": [\"A MOS - UKR\", \"F SEV - RUM\", \"F STP/SC - LVN\", \"A WAR - GAL\"]\n    }\n}\n```"

Key territories for potential expansion include Scandinavia (particularly Norway), the Balkans, and potentially pressuring Turkey via the Black Sea.\n\n3. **Potential Actions**:\n   - **Norway**: A viable target given its proximity to St. Petersburg and the relatively open nature of Scandinavia in the early game.\n   - **Balkans**: Engaging here might be too aggressive towards Austria and Turkey early on, risking my southern flank.\n   - **Black Sea**: Essential to control if a conflict with Turkey is anticipated.\n\n4. **Unit Analysis and Orders**:\n   - **Fleet in Livonia (F LVN)**: With options to move into Baltic areas, a strategic choice is moving towards Sweden or supporting actions in Prussia. However, moving into Sweden directly threatens Germany and might provoke England as well.\n   - **Fleet in Rumania (F RUM)**: Holding in Rumania is stable, but moving into the Black Sea could provide strategic leverage over Turkey.\n   - **Army in Ukraine (A UKR)**: Central and can support actions in Rumania or move towards more aggressive stances like attacking Galicia or supporting in Sevastopol.\n   - **Army in Warsaw (A WAR)**: Can either move towards Silesia to threaten Germany or support eastern actions towards Galicia.\n\n**Proposed Orders**:\nGiven these considerations, the following orders might balance expansion with defense:\n\n1. **F LVN - BAL**: Fleet in Livonia moves to the Baltic Sea to exert pressure on Scandinavian and German territories.\n2. **F RUM - BLA**: Fleet in Rumania moves to the Black Sea, opening options against Turkey and securing southern defenses.\n3. **A UKR - RUM**: Army in Ukraine moves to Rumania, possibly preparing for further Balkan engagements or fortifying positions against potential Balkan hostilities.\n4. **A WAR - GAL**: Army in Warsaw moves to Galicia to challenge Austrian influence and expand Russian control in the Balkans.\n\n**Strategic Reasoning**:\n- **Northern Expansion**: By moving the Livonian fleet to the Baltic Sea, there is an implied threat to both Sweden and potentially Berlin, spreading defensive focus of Germany and possibly England, aiding in indirect Russian strategies.\n- **Southern Strategy**: Moving into the Black Sea and reinforcing Rumania creates a dual threat towards Turkey, either diplomatically inducing caution or preparing for military engagements.\n- **Central Pressure**: Moving into Galicia challenges Austria directly, which could either lead to early concessions or a strong defensive pact\u2014both of which need to be diplomatically navigated but could result in strategic gains.\n\n**JSON Output**:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"F1901M\",\n    \"step_by_step_reasoning\": \"Reviewed unit positions, analyzed regional threats and opportunities, proposed balanced orders focusing on both expansion and defense.\",\n    \"reason\": \"Northern expansion through Baltic Sea increases pressure on Scandinavia and Germany.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

          "content": "Given the current state of the game as Russia in the Spring of 1902, with the units and their positions along with the objectives and rules of the game, here is the strategic plan:\n\n### Strategic Reasoning:\nAs Russia, we currently control a strong presence in both northern and southern parts of the map with units in key strategic areas. Our primary goal is to expand our influence to nearby supply centers while defending the ones we already hold. Given our geographical disposition, we have an opportunity to exert pressure on Austria and Turkey, both of whom share borders with our units. \n\nOur units are strategically placed to either support each other or make significant movements. The Fleet in Rumania (RUM) can exert naval influence in the Black Sea, potentially cutting off Turkish movements and supply lines. Our army in Galicia (GAL) can either move to support operations against Austria or defend against incoming threats. Our Army in Ukraine (UKR) can support movements towards Rumania or defend against any potential threats from the south. The Fleet in Baltic Sea (BAL) can support movements in northern Europe or help defend our interests against German advances.\n\n### Objective and Orders:\n\n1. **Objective with the Fleet in Rumania (RUM):** Aim to control the Black Sea to disrupt Turkish fleets and their convoy routes. This could leave Turkey vulnerable and unable to support their armies effectively.\n\n2. **Objective with the Army in Galicia (GAL):** Prepare to support a potential move against Austria or defend against Austrian aggression. Flexibility here is key depending on Austria's moves.\n\n3. **Objective with the Army in Ukraine (UKR):** Enhance defensive posture around Rumania and potentially support an advance into Rumania if Austria weakens their hold.\n\n4. **Objective with the Fleet in Baltic Sea (BAL):** Utilize to support actions against Germany or defend Russian territories against German naval movements.\n\n### Reasoning Validation:\n- All moves align with the objective of territorial expansion or defense.\n- Ensured that all targets for attacks are not currently controlled by Russia and that they are adjacent to the attacking units.\n- Confirmed that each support move matches the adjacent regions and the support is correctly directed towards valid moves.\n\n### Proposed Orders for Russia:\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"S1902M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Expand influence in the Black Sea; defend against Austrian and Turkish advances; prepare for future expansion to the west and south.\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"MOS\", \"STP\", \"WAR\", \"RUM\", \"UKR\", \"GAL\", \"BAL\"],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"F RUM\", \"A GAL\", \"A UKR\", \"F BAL\"],\n    \"adjacent\": [\n        {\"RUM\": [\"SEV\", \"UKR\", \"BUL/EC\", \"BLA\"]},\n        {\"GAL\": [\"BOH\", \"BUD\", \"RUM\", \"UKR\", \"WAR\", \"VIE\"]},\n        {\"UKR\": [\"RUM\", \"GAL\", \"WAR\", \"MOS\", \"SEV\"]},\n        {\"BAL\": [\"LVN\", \"PRU\", \"BER\", \"KIE\"]}\n    ],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"BUL\", \"VIE\", \"BUD\", \"BER\", \"KIE\"],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    \"attackable\": [\"SEV\", \"BLA\", \"BOH\", \"BUD\", \"VIE\", \"BER\", \"KIE\"],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [\n        {\"SEV\": 2}, {\"BLA\": 1}, {\"BOH\": 2},\n        {\"BUD\": 2}, {\"VIE\": 2}, {\"BER\": 3}, {\"KIE\": 3}\n    ],\n    \"support_given\": [\n        {\"supporter\": \"GAL\", \"supported\": \"UKR\", \"target\": \"RUM\"},\n        {\"supporter\": \"UKR\", \"supported\": \"GAL\", \"target\": \"BUD\"}\n    ],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"TURKEY\": [1, 0],\n        \"AUSTRIA\": [1, 1],\n        \"GERMANY\": [1, 1]\n    },\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"RUSSIA\": [\n            \"F RUM - BLA\",\n            \"A GAL S A UKR - RUM\",\n            \"A UKR S A GAL - BUD\",\n            \"F BAL S F KIE - BER\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this plan, the focus is on expanding control in vital areas, countering moves from potential adversaries, and setting the stage for a robust defensive structure to protect existing supply centers."

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

          "content": "Given the current state of the game and the positions of my units as Russia, I have to carefully plan my moves to maximize both my defenses and my opportunities for expansion. Here is the analysis based on the game situation:\n\n### Strategic Analysis and Justification:\n\n- **Positional Analysis:**\n  I control significant territories in the eastern and northern parts of the map, including Moscow, St. Petersburg, Warsaw, Ukraine, Galicia, Rumania, and the Baltic and Black Seas. This gives me a strong position to influence both the northern and southern strategies.\n\n- **Expansion Opportunities:**\n  My immediate targets for expansion should be controlling more supply centers. Norway, currently under English control, is an attractive target considering my fleet in the Baltic Sea. Additionally, expanding further into the Balkans by moving into Austria-Hungary territories like Budapest through Galicia might be a viable option. Furthermore, solidifying control over the Black Sea region is crucial, which may entail dislodging Turkish forces in Ankara or Constantinople.\n\n- **Defense Concerns:**\n  Turkey appears as a direct threat in the south, holding positions close to my territories like Sevastopol. Defending Rumania and potentially reinforcing it from surrounding units in Ukraine or Galicia is a priority.\n\n### Proposed Orders and Rationale:\n- **Fleet Baltic Sea (BAL):**\n  - Move BAL to Sweden (SWE) to build pressure against English and German naval units and position myself closer to potentially critical regions like Norway in the future. (`F BAL - SWE`)\n\n- **Fleet Black Sea (BLA):**\n  - Support hold in Rumania from Black Sea to prevent any surprise moves by the Turks. This move ensures that my hold in the Black Sea remains robust. (`F BLA S A RUM`)\n\n- **Army Galicia (GAL):**\n  - Support attack on Budapest from Ukraine, coordinating with the unit in Ukraine to potentially displace Austrian forces and gain a critical supply center in the heart of Europe. (`A GAL S A UKR - BUD`)\n\n- **Army Ukraine (UKR):**\n  - Attack Budapest.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

My current units are positioned in Galicia, Ukraine, and Sweden, providing a mix of strategic offensive and defensive opportunities. Given the locations of other powers, particularly the proximity of Turkey and Austria which are traditional threats to Russian interests in the area, my strategy will focus on solidifying control and preparing for expansion.\n\n1. **Galicia (A GAL)**:\n    - Positioned between key areas including Budapest, Vienna, and Rumania.\n    - Offers potential support roles or direct moves into Austria or Rumania, depending on the vulnerability and diplomatic status with neighbors.\n\n2. **Sweden (F SWE)**:\n    - A fleet in Sweden allows control over the northern seas (Baltic Sea and Norwegian Sea) and can support moves into Norway or Denmark if necessary.\n    - Can be used defensively to hold Sweden or support nearby territories like St. Petersburg or Norway against possible English or German advances.\n\n3. **Ukraine (A UKR)**:\n    - Can act as a support unit for moves in Southeastern Europe or launch attacks into Rumania or Sevastopol if Turkey becomes hostile.\n    - Provides flexibility in either moving back towards Moscow for defense or pushing into Balkan territories held by Austria or Turkey.\n\nGiven the adjacency of my units and the potential threats from Turkey and Austria, my orders will focus on solidifying control while preparing for potential expansions. The order choices will be defensive but ready to exploit any openings provided by the movements of other powers.\n\n## Orders\n\nHere are the specific orders planned:\n\n1. **Galicia (A GAL)**:\n   - Move to Rumania. This move is aimed at contesting control of an important supply center and disrupting Turkish influence in the area.\n   - Since Galicia borders Rumania and no significant immediate threat from adjacent Austrian territories, this move is feasible.\n \n2. **Sweden (F SWE)**:\n   - Hold. This maintains control of Sweden and keeps the Fleet ready to support actions in the Baltic or Norwegian Seas.\n   - Holding also prevents the fleet from being stretched too thin across multiple fronts.\n\n3. **Ukraine (A UKR)**:\n   - Support move from Galicia to Rumania. This reinforces the attack on Rumania, ensuring that if Turkey tries to hold or counter-move, the support increases the chances of a successful Russian advance.\n   - Ukraine is crucial for bolstering moves towards the Balkans and provides a defensive buffer for Moscow.\n\n### JSON Representation of the Orders:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"phase\": \"S1903M\",\n  \"reason\": \"Expanding control in Balkans, defending existing territories, and preparing for potential engagements with Turkey and Austria. Focusing on consolidating positions while maintaining flexibility for future offensives.\",\n  \"my_location\": [\"SWE\", \"GAL\", \"UKR\"],\n  \"my_unit\": [\"F SWE\", \"A GAL\", \"A UKR\"],\n  \"adjacent\": [{\"GAL\": [\"BOH\", \"BUD\", \"RUM\", \"SIL\", \"UKR\", \"VIE\", \"WAR\"]}, {\"SWE\": [\"BAL\", \"BOT\", \"DEN\", \"FIN\", \"NWY\", \"SKA\"]}, {\"UKR\": [\"GAL\", \"MOS\", \"RUM\", \"SEV\", \"WAR\"]}],\n  \"other_power_location\": [\"RUM\", \"BUD\", \"NWY\"],\n  \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [1, 1, 1],\n  \"attackable\": [\"RUM\"],\n  \"attack_analysis\": [{\"RUM\": 2}],\n  \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"UKR\", \"supported\": \"GAL\", \"target\": \"RUM\"}],\n  \"attack_mask\": {\n    \"RUSSIA\": [1, 0, 1]\n  },\n  \"orders\": {\n    \"RUSSIA\": [\"F SWE H\", \"A GAL - RUM\", \"A UKR S A GAL - RUM\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith these orders, Russia aims to strengthen its position in Eastern Europe while staying prepared to respond to movements from other powers. The focus is on securing and expanding influence without overextending forces."

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

          "content": "Given the current state of the game and my position as Russia, I will outline my strategic analysis, reasoning, and orders for the Fall 1903 Movement phase.\n\n### Strategic Reasoning:\n\n- **Current Position and Analysis:**\n  - I control Moscow, Warsaw, Sweden, Rumania but have units positioned in Ukraine, Sweden, and Rumania.\n  - The adjacent territories from Ukraine are Moscow, Rumania, Sevastopol, Galicia, and Warsaw. From Sweden, it's Baltic Sea, Bothnia, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Skagerrak. From Rumania, options include Bulgaria, Budapest, Serbia, Sevastopol, Ukraine, and Galicia.\n  - My key objective is to secure as many supply centers as possible, primarily targeting vulnerable and adjacent supply centers.\n\n- **Opportunity and Threat Analysis:**\n  - Turkey is a direct competitor for control in the Balkans and Black Sea region. Control of Sevastopol, currently a Turkish-held territory, is pivotal.\n  - Germany poses a threat from the north-west; however, they are currently entangled with England and France, potentially allowing me to focus on consolidating power in the south and east.\n\n- **Expansion Plans:**\n  - Prioritize taking Sevastopol back from Turkey to secure my southern flank and increase my supply center count.\n  - Consolidate control in the Balkans by supporting movements into Bulgaria if feasible or defending Rumania aggressively.\n  - Maintain stability in the northern territories using Sweden's fleet.\n\n### Orders:\n\n1. **For the Army in Ukraine (A UKR):**\n   - **Order:** Move to Sevastopol (A UKR - SEV)\n   - **Reasoning:** Sevastopol is currently controlled by Turkey. Recapturing this supply center is critical to securing the southern frontier and countering Turkish influence.\n\n2. **For the Fleet in Sweden (F SWE):**\n   - **Order:** Hold (F SWE H)\n   - **Reasoning:** Sweden's strategic position in the north needs to be maintained defensively this turn to ascertain moves by German and English fleets. Holding ensures no surprise takeovers.\n\n3. **For the Army in Rumania (A RUM):**\n   - **Order:** Support Army Ukraine to Sevastopol (A RUM S A UKR - SEV)\n   - **Reasoning:** Support from Rumania will increase the likelihood of successfully moving into Sevastopol, overcoming potential defenses by Turkey.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"F1903M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Focus on recapturing Sevastopol to secure southern defenses and maintain control in the northern region while assessing the situation in the Balkans for future expansion.\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"MOS\", \"WAR\", \"SWE\", \"RUM\"],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"UKR\", \"SWE\", \"RUM\"],\n    \"adjacent\": [\n        {\"UKR\": [\"MOS\", \"WAR\", \"RUM\", \"SEV\", \"GAL\"]},\n        {\"SWE\": [\"BAL\", \"BOT\", \"DEN\", \"FIN\", \"NWY\", \"SKA\"]},\n        {\"RUM\": [\"UKR\", \"SEV\", \"BUL\", \"SER\", \"BUD\", \"GAL\"]}\n    ],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"SEV\", \"BUL\", \"BUD\", \"SER\"],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 0, 0],\n    \"attackable\": [\"SEV\"],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [\n        {\"SEV\": 2}\n    ],\n    \"support_given\": [\n        {\"supporter\": \"RUM\", \"supported\": \"UKR\", \"target\": \"SEV\"}\n    ],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"RUSSIA\": [1, 0, 0]\n    },\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"RUSSIA\": [\"A UKR - SEV\", \"F SWE H\", \"A RUM S A UKR - SEV\"]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis strategic plan aims for a measured expansion while solidifying current holdings and preparing for possible escalations in both the north and south."

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Sweden's defense is also key against potential threats from the north.\n\n2. **Identify Targets and Threats:**\n   - **Targets for Expansion**: Based on the map's adjacency, Turkey's territories are vulnerable. Bulgaria (BUL) and Ankara (ANK) could be potential targets.\n   - **Defensive Priorities**: Maintaining control over current holdings, especially SEV and WAR, against any counterattacks.\n\n3. **Formulating Potential Orders:**\n   - From RUM, supporting actions into SEV and potentially attacking BUL seems viable.\n   - SEV can support actions in RUM or take offensive moves toward ANK or BUL.\n   - SWE needs to defend the Nordic area, ideally holding position or supporting nearby naval units.\n   - WAR may consider supporting actions in SEV, or moving defensively toward MOS or PRU.\n\n4. **Evaluating Support and Movement Options:**\n   - **RUM**: Given its central position, it can either support SEV or move against BUL, depending on the support from other units.\n   - **SEV**: Can support RUM or launch an attack towards BUL or ANK, critical points against Turkey.\n   - **SWE**: Holding or supporting neighboring sea zones is crucial.\n   - **WAR**: Supporting defensive lines or moving towards MOS for eastern reinforcement.\n\n5. **Final Order Consideration**:\n   - Ensure that all movements or supports are directed toward strengthening positions or expanding into strategically important supply centers.\n   - Coordinate supports to ensure successful movements where conflicts might occur.\n   - Defend essential territories from possible encroachments.\n\nGiven these considerations, the orders for Russia might look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"S1904M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Expanding influence in the Black Sea region targeting vulnerable Turkish territories while defending core territories from potential northern and southern threats.\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"WAR\", \"SWE\", \"SEV\", \"RUM\"],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"A WAR\", \"F SWE\", \"A SEV\", \"A RUM\"],\n    \"adjacent\": [\n        {\"RUM\": [\"BLA\", \"BUD\", \"BUL/EC\", \"GAL\", \"SER\", \"SEV\", \"UKR\"]},\n        {\"SEV\": [\"ARM\", \"BLA\", \"MOS\", \"RUM\", \"UKR\"]},\n        {\"SWE\": [\"BAL\", \"BOT\", \"DEN\", \"FIN\", \"NWY\", \"SKA\"]},\n        {\"WAR\": [\"GAL\", \"LVN\", \"MOS\", \"PRU\", \"SIL\", \"UKR\"]}\n    ],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"BUL\", \"ANK\"],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 0, 1, 1],\n    \"attackable\": [\"BUL\", \"ANK\"],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"BUL\": 2}, {\"ANK\": 2}],\n    \"support_given\": [\n        {\"supporter\": \"A SEV\", \"supported\": \"A RUM\", \"target\": \"BUL\"},\n        {\"supporter\": \"A RUM\", \"supported\": \"A SEV\", \"target\": \"BUL\"}\n    ],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"RUSSIA\": [0, 0, 1, 1]\n    },\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"RUSSIA\": [\"A WAR H\", \"F SWE H\", \"A SEV S A RUM - BUL\", \"A RUM - BUL\"]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis strategy focuses on consolidating power in the Black Sea, potentially taking Bulgaria, which is a strategic move against Turkey. The orders reflect a combined attack and support strategy in the south, with defensive holds in the north and west to secure the current holdings."

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

          "content": "Let's develop a strategic plan based on the current game state and the potential options available to Russia.\n\n### Strategic Reasoning:\n\n1. **Consolidation and Protection**: It's crucial to consolidate the strengths I currently possess while strategically expanding. I control critical supply centers in SWE, BUL, RUM, and MOS and must ensure these remain under my influence.\n2. **Expansion**: I need to focus on expanding further to both safeguard my position and progressively aim towards the victory condition. \n3. **Threat Analysis**: Notably under direct threat are BUL and RUM due to proximity to other powers like Turkey. They need essential defense and possibly reinforcements.\n4. **Opportunity for Growth**: Considering the adjacency and the current weak points of enemies, the Balkans and Scandinavia provide substantial opportunities for expansion. STP/NC, controlled by Germany, is another strategic point worth contesting.\n\n### Move Analysis:\n\n**Unit in SWE**: It has potential moves towards DEN or NWY, which can help in weakening Germany's control in Scandinavia. However, the focus should be on supporting adjacent units or holding the position to prevent any advances from the West.\n\n**Unit in BUL**: This is a critical area close to many conflicts. Options include supporting defensive actions in RUM or taking a more aggressive stance by moving towards SER or GRE, although these require careful consideration of nearby enemy units and support.\n\n**Unit in RUM**: Given its position, it can act defensively by supporting BUL or offensively by moving into SER or BUD. Due to proximity, it's also pivotal in defending against potential advances from Turkey.\n\n**Unit in MOS**: This unit can provide support to SWE or RUM (particularly against SEV) or push towards UKR which could pave the way for southern advances or defensive stances against European powers.\n\n### Proposed Orders:\n\n**Unit SWE**:\n- Fleet SWE moves to DEN to contest German control and expand Russian influence into Scandinavia.\n\n**Unit BUL**:\n- Army BUL holds, ready to support RUM or counter any advances from Turkey into the Balkan region.\n\n**Unit RUM**:\n- Army RUM supports Army BUL, providing a defensive reinforcement against potential threats from the Turkish units in ANK or ARM. \n\n**Unit MOS**:\n- Army MOS moves to UKR as a strategic maneuver to strengthen the southern defensive line and possibly push further in future turns.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"F1905M\",\n    \"reason\": \"The strategy focuses on both defending the existing supply centers and expanding influence in key areas like Scandinavia and the Balkans.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

          "content": "**Strategic Reasoning for Russia's Fall 1906 Moves:**\n\nRussia's goal for the Fall of 1906 is to consolidate power and expand influence by focusing on securing additional supply centers and strengthening defenses. With control over key territories like Sweden, Bulgaria, Rumania, Ukraine, and Sevastopol, there is an opportunity to both defend current assets and strategically attack to disrupt the positions of neighboring powers.\n\n**Current Analysis and Strategy:**\n\n- **Defensive Strategy:**\n  - Strengthen the defense of Sevastopol. This is crucial given its proximity to hostile Turkish forces in Armenia.\n  - Maintain a strong presence in Sweden to deter German advances from Norway.\n\n- **Offensive Strategy:**\n  - A critical focus will be on Bulgaria and its surrounding regions. There are multiple neighboring powers, making it a hotspot for action.\n  - Consider advancing into strategic regions like Serbia or Greece if opportunities arise, potentially destabilizing the Balkans further.\n\n**Order Planning:**\n\n1. **Bulgaria (BUL):** \n    - This unit has a pivotal role in securing the south. Consider moving to Serbia if the analysis suggests it's lightly defended. Otherwise, hold or support adjacent moves to maintain regional stability.\n\n2. **Rumania (RUM):**\n    - Key for controlling the Black Sea and supporting moves into the Balkans or countering moves from Turkey. Support actions from Sevastopol might be necessary.\n\n3. **Sevastopol (SEV):**\n    - Primarily a defensive unit this turn. Its role will be to offer support to Rumania or counter moves from the Black Sea.\n\n4. **Sweden (SWE):**\n    - Should focus on supporting defensive operations or making a strategic move against Norway if it appears vulnerable.\n\n5. **Ukraine (UKR):**\n    - Acts as a supporting unit for operations in Rumania or offensive moves into surrounding territories like Galicia if the situation allows.\n\n**JSON Output for Orders:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"Fall 1906\",\n    \"reason\": \"Russia aims to fortify defenses while looking for opportunities to expand in the Balkans and Black Sea region.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Provide support to hold or move to influence other areas.\n- **A RUM:** Also vulnerable. Should support A BUL and/or F SEV in their actions.\n- **F SEV:** Positioned to support movements in Black Sea or support land movements into the Balkans or Turkey.\n- **F SKA:** Relatively distant from other action regions. Could be used to support movements or defenses in the North.\n- **A UKR:** Can support movements into RUM or potentially move to bolster defenses in surrounding regions.\n\n### Orders for F1906M:\nGiven the units and their current locations, here are possible orders that focus on defensive posture while preparing for potential expansion.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"phase\": \"F1906M\",\n  \"reason\": \"Focusing on defending current supply centers and preparing for strategic expansion into Balkans and Black Sea regions.\",\n  \"my_location\": [\"WAR\", \"SWE\", \"SEV\", \"BUL\", \"RUM\"],\n  \"my_unit\": [\"BUL\", \"RUM\", \"SEV\", \"SKA\", \"UKR\"],\n  \"adjacent\": [{\"RUM\": [\"BLA\", \"BUD\", \"BUL/EC\", \"GAL\", \"SER\", \"SEV\", \"UKR\"]}, {\"SEV\": [\"ARM\", \"BLA\", \"MOS\", \"RUM\", \"UKR\"]}, {\"SKA\": [\"DEN\", \"NWY\", \"NTH\", \"SWE\"]}, {\"UKR\": [\"GAL\", \"MOS\", \"RUM\", \"SEV\", \"WAR\"]}],\n  \"other_power_location\": [\"BUD\", \"SER\", \"ARM\"],\n  \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n  \"attackable\": [\"BUD\", \"SER\", \"ARM\"],\n  \"attack_analysis\": [{\"BUD\": 2}, {\"SER\": 2}, {\"ARM\": 2}],\n  \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"RUM\", \"supported\": \"BUL\", \"target\": \"SER\"}, {\"supporter\": \"SEV\", \"supported\": \"RUM\", \"target\": \"BUL\"}],\n  \"attack_mask\": {\n    \"RUSSIA\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  },\n  \"orders\": {\n    \"RUSSIA\": [\"A BUL H\", \"A RUM S A BUL\", \"F SEV S A RUM\", \"F SKA S F SEV\", \"A UKR S A RUM\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **A BUL H:** Army in Bulgaria holds to defend the supply center.\n- **A RUM S A BUL:** Army in Rumania supports Army in Bulgaria. This strengthens defenses against potential attacks from Balkans or Turkey.\n- **F SEV S A RUM:** Fleet in Sevastopol supports the Army in Rumania. It provides additional defensive capabilities.\n- **F SKA S F SEV:** Fleet in Skagerrak supports Fleet in Sevastopol, reinforcing movements or defensive actions in and around the Black Sea.\n- **A UKR S A RUM:** Army in Ukraine supports Army in Rumania, adding another layer of support and defense.\n\nThis set of orders aims to consolidate control of key areas while positioning for future offensives depending on the evolving strategic situation."

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Maintaining control over Sevastopol is essential due to its strategic positioning and being a home supply center.\n- **Expansion Opportunities:** \n  - Northern expansion via Scandinavia using F SKA.\n  - Solidifying control in the Black Sea region by reinforcing Sevastopol and pushing into the Balkans or Turkey if opportunities arise.\n\n### Order Planning and Justification\n\n#### 1. **Fleet in Skagerrak (F SKA)**\n- **Order:** F SKA - DEN\n- **Reasoning:** Move to Denmark (DEN) to strengthen northern control and potentially challenge German control. It opens the possibility of supporting Sweden or attacking Norway.\n\n#### 2. **Army in Bulgaria (A BUL)**\n- **Order:** A BUL - SER\n- **Reasoning:** Move into Serbia (SER) to challenge Austrian control in the Balkans, which can potentially increase the number of supply centers.\n\n#### 3. **Army in Romania (A RUM)**\n- **Order:** A RUM S A BUL - SER\n- **Reasoning:** Provide support to the Bulgarian army moving into Serbia. This increases the chances of successfully taking Serbia.\n\n#### 4. **Fleet in Sevastopol (F SEV)**\n- **Order:** F SEV - BLA\n- **Reasoning:** Move to the Black Sea (BLA) to gain naval superiority in this strategic area, potentially threatening Turkish holdings.\n\n#### 5. **Army in Ukraine (A UKR)**\n- **Order:** A UKR S F SEV - BLA\n- **Reasoning:** Support the fleet's movement from Sevastopol to the Black Sea, ensuring its success against any potential resistance.\n\n### JSON Object for Orders:\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"S1907M\",\n    \"reason\": \"As Russia, my strategy is to expand in Northern Europe and the Balkans while reinforcing my position in the Black Sea against potential Turkish threats.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

(Please refer to the game state)\n     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.\n     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`\n\n   - **attackable:**\n     - A list of locations.\n     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.\n     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **attack_analysis:**\n    - A list of dictionaries.\n    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.\n    - Example: `[{\"MUN\": 2}, {\"RUH\": 1} ...]`\n\n   - **support_given:**\n     - A list of dictionaries.\n     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)\n     - Example: `[{\"supporter\": \"BOH\", \"supported\": \"MUN\", \"target\": \"TYR\"}, ...]`\n\n   - **attack_mask:**\n     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the \"orders\" list.\n     - Each element corresponds to an order in the \"orders\" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.\n     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.\n     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.\n     - Example: `{\"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...], ...}`\n\n3. **Orders:**\n    - The \"orders\" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.\n    - For each location, you can only issue one order.\n    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.\n    - Each string represents an order for a unit.\n    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the \"orders\" field empty for that power.\n\n4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**\n   - Use standard straight double quotes (`\"`).\n   - Do not include special characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.\n   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.\n\n### **Possible Orders:**\n\nAll the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):\n\n<possible_orders>\n{'RUSSIA': {'BUL': ['A BUL S F AEG - CON', 'A BUL - ARM VIA', 'A BUL S A ARM - CON', 'A BUL S F SEV - RUM', 'A BUL - ANK VIA', 'A BUL S F ION - GRE', 'A BUL - RUM VIA', 'A BUL - SMY VIA', 'A BUL S A SER', 'A BUL - GRE', 'A BUL - APU VIA', 'A BUL - CON', 'A BUL S A SER - RUM', 'A BUL S A RUM - SER', 'A BUL S A RUM', 'A BUL S A UKR - RUM', 'A BUL S F BLA - RUM', 'A BUL S F GRE', 'A BUL S A ALB - GRE', 'A BUL - CON VIA', 'A BUL - SEV VIA', 'A BUL S A BUD - SER', 'A BUL S A ARM - RUM', 'A BUL S A SER - GRE', 'A BUL S A RUM - CON', 'A BUL - SER', 'A BUL S F AEG - GRE', 'A BUL H', 'A BUL - RUM', 'A BUL S A BUD - RUM', 'A BUL S F BLA - CON', 'A BUL S A ALB - SER', 'A BUL - TUN VIA', 'A BUL - GRE VIA', 'A BUL - NAP VIA', 'A BUL - ALB VIA', 'A BUL S A ALB - CON'], 'RUM': ['A RUM - BUL', 'A RUM S A BUD - SER', 'A RUM - ARM VIA', 'A RUM H', 'A RUM S F GRE - BUL', 'A RUM S F SEV', 'A RUM - ANK VIA', 'A RUM S A ARM - BUL', 'A RUM S A SER', 'A RUM S A SER - BUL', 'A RUM S A BUD - GAL', 'A RUM - BUD', 'A RUM - BUL VIA', 'A RUM S F GRE - BUL/SC', 'A RUM S A BUD', 'A RUM S F BLA - SEV', 'A RUM - SEV VIA', 'A RUM S A VIE - GAL', 'A RUM S F AEG - BUL', 'A RUM - CON VIA', 'A RUM S F AEG - BUL/SC', 'A RUM S A ARM - SEV', 'A RUM - UKR', 'A RUM S A BUL', 'A RUM S A UKR - GAL', 'A RUM S A UKR', 'A RUM S A SER - BUD', 'A RUM - SER', 'A RUM S A UKR - SEV', 'A RUM - GAL', 'A RUM S A VIE - BUD', 'A RUM S A BUL - SEV', 'A RUM S F BLA - BUL', 'A RUM - SEV', 'A RUM S A ALB - SER', 'A RUM S F BLA - BUL/EC', 'A RUM S A BUL - SER', 'A RUM S A ALB - BUL'], 'SEV': ['F SEV S A UKR - RUM', 'F SEV S A ARM - RUM', 'F SEV S A BUD - RUM', 'F SEV S F BLA - RUM', 'F SEV S A ARM', 'F SEV S A SER - RUM', 'F SEV S A BUL - ARM', 'F SEV - RUM', 'F SEV S A RUM', 'F SEV S F BLA', 'F SEV S A BUL - RUM', 'F SEV - BLA', 'F SEV - ARM', 'F SEV S A RUM - ARM', 'F SEV S F BLA - ARM', 'F SEV H'], 'SKA': ['F SKA - NWY', 'F SKA C A BEL - SWE', 'F SKA - DEN', 'F SKA S F NTH - DEN', 'F SKA S A KIE - DEN', 'F SKA S A YOR - NWY', 'F SKA S F BAR - NWY', 'F SKA S F HOL - NTH', 'F SKA S F NTH', 'F SKA S F BAL - SWE', 'F SKA S A KIE - SWE', 'F SKA S A BEL - DEN', 'F SKA C A YOR - SWE', 'F SKA S F NTH - NWY', 'F SKA - SWE', 'F SKA - NTH', 'F SKA S F BAL - DEN', 'F SKA H', 'F SKA S A YOR - DEN', 'F SKA S A BEL - NWY'], 'UKR': ['A UKR - GAL', 'A UKR - WAR', 'A UKR H', 'A UKR S A ARM - SEV', 'A UKR S A ARM - RUM', 'A UKR S F BLA - SEV', 'A UKR S F BLA - RUM', 'A UKR - SEV', 'A UKR S A BUL - RUM', 'A UKR S A VIE - GAL', 'A UKR S A RUM', 'A UKR - MOS', 'A UKR S F SEV', 'A UKR S F SEV - RUM', 'A UKR S A BUL - SEV', 'A UKR S A SER - RUM', 'A UKR S A RUM - GAL', 'A UKR S A BUD - RUM', 'A UKR - RUM', 'A UKR S A BUD - GAL', 'A UKR S A RUM - SEV']}}\n</possible_orders>\n\n### **Your Objective:**\n\nYour ultimate goal is absolute domination\u2014seize every supply center and crush your opposition to win!

Checking and revision are necessary closer to the execution phase to adjust to the evolving diplomatic landscape and responses from other powers."

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

The goal is to bolster defenses while also considering opportunities to expand influence, particularly focusing on gaining more supply centers necessary for building additional units.\n\n2. **Threats and Opportunities**:\n   - **Turkey** poses a direct threat from the south with units in Black Sea (BLA) and other adjacent territories.\n   - **Germany** has a powerful presence in central Europe which can be concerning but also offers a potential ally against other strong powers.\n   - Potential expansion into northern Europe (Scandinavia) using Sweden.\n\n3. **Current Unit Positions and Movements**:\n   - **BUL**: Positioned effectively against Turkey, a critical juncture for both defense and offensive operations.\n   - **GAL**: Central to operations against Austria and potential to support moves in Ukraine or Rumania.\n   - **RUM**: Vital for defending against the southern flank, especially from Turkish aggressions.\n   - **SWE**: Offers naval opportunities in the Baltic and potential land movements towards Scandinavia.\n\n### Proposed Orders and Rationale:\n\nHere's the considered approach for each unit:\n\n1. **Army Bulgaria (A BUL)**:\n   - **Order**: A BUL - CON\n   - **Rationale**: Move to Constantinople to pressure Turkish defenses, leveraging a direct approach to weaken Turkey\u2019s hold and potentially capture a crucial supply center.\n\n2. **Army Galicia (A GAL)**:\n   - **Order**: A GAL S A RUM - BUD\n   - **Rationale**: Support move from Rumania to Budapest to expand influence into Austria, exploiting the vulnerabilities created by potential conflicts with other powers.\n\n3. **Army Rumania (A RUM)**:\n   - **Order**: A RUM - BUD\n   - **Rationale**: Move into Budapest if Turkish forces appear weakened or distracted, aiming for territorial expansion and weakening Austria\u2019s position.\n\n4. **Fleet Sweden (F SWE)**:\n   - **Order**: F SWE - DEN\n   - **Rationale**: Move to Denmark to extend naval reach and prepare for further operations either into Germany\u2019s maritime zones or toward Norway, expanding control over additional supply centers in Scandinavia.\n\n### JSON Output for Orders:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"F1908M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Expanding influence in key strategic areas while defending existing territories; targeting weak spots in Turkey and Austria for potential gains.\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"WAR\", \"SEV\", \"SWE\", \"BUL\", \"RUM\"],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BUL\", \"GAL\", \"RUM\", \"SWE\"],\n    \"adjacent\": [\n        {\"GAL\": [\"BOH\", \"BUD\", \"RUM\", \"SIL\", \"UKR\", \"VIE\", \"WAR\"]},\n        {\"RUM\": [\"BLA\", \"BUD\", \"BUL/EC\", \"GAL\", \"SER\", \"SEV\", \"UKR\"]},\n        {\"SWE\": [\"BAL\", \"BOT\", \"DEN\", \"FIN\", \"NWY\", \"SKA\"]}\n    ],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"BUD\", \"CON\", \"DEN\"],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    \"attackable\": [\"CON\", \"BUD\", \"DEN\"],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"CON\": 2}, {\"BUD\": 2}, {\"DEN\": 2}],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"GAL\", \"supported\": \"RUM\", \"target\": \"BUD\"}],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"TURKEY\": [1, 0],\n        \"AUSTRIA\": [1, 1],\n        \"GERMANY\": [1]\n    },\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"RUSSIA\": [\"A BUL - CON\", \"A GAL S A RUM - BUD\", \"A RUM - BUD\", \"F SWE - DEN\"]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis strategy focuses on maximizing territorial gains while being prepared to defend against counter-moves from rival powers. The use of support, offensive movements, and strategic positioning should ideally place Russia in a stronger position by the end of this phase."

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Below, I'll analyze the potential moves, supports, and threats based on the available data, unit positions, and strategic positioning of opposing forces.\n\n1. **Analyzing Current Positions and Strategic Goals:**\n\n   - **BUD (Budapest):** Situated amidst several strategic points, surrounded by friendly units in GAL and SER, making it a central point for staging attacks or providing supports.\n\n   - **GAL (Galicia):** Borders Ukrainian territories and is well-positioned to either move to dislodge enemy units in RUM (if any) or support adjacent units for a northern push or safeguarding efforts.\n\n   - **WAR (Warsaw):** Offers routes towards the north (Baltic regions) and the east (Ukraine and Moscow).

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

This strategic process will involve analyzing the surrounding environment, potential threats, and opportunities for expansion.\n\n### Recap, Current Control and Analysis\nRussia controls:\n- **Supply Centers**: Warsaw, Bulgaria, Romania, Budapest, Denmark\n- **Units**: Army in Bulgaria (A BUL), Army in Budapest (A BUD), Army in Romania (A RUM), Army in Prussia (A PRU), Fleet in Skagerrak (F SKA)\n\n### Strategy and Possible Moves:\n1. **Defending Key Areas**: Focus on defending crucial areas such as Bulgaria and Romania which are close to Turkey and could be targets for expansion.\n\n2. **Expanding Influence**: Look to expand influence into non-controlled but reachable territories, especially those that are supply centers or can provide strategic advantages.\n\n3. **Forming Alliances**: Temporarily forming alliances can be beneficial, but with Germany's expansive presence, it may be necessary to counteract their growth.\n\n4. **Detailed Orders Plan**:\n   - **Budapest (A BUD)**: With armies in nearby regions, Budapest can play a critical role either in supporting adjacent territories or defending against attacks.\n   - **Bulgaria (A BUL)**: Should continue to secure the area and potentially support movements into strategic territories such as Greece or Serbia if not currently held by an ally.\n   - **Romania (A RUM)**: Central to Eastern Europe, Romania could support attacks or holds in Bulgaria or Ukraine, depending on threats.\n   - **Prussia (A PRU)**: Located near Germany, Prussia can either fortify its position or support offensive moves into German territory if needed.\n   - **Skagerrak (F SKA)**: This fleet can support movements into Denmark or Norway, potentially pressuring England or defending against northern movements.\n\n### Example Orders:\n- **A BUD** to hold, providing stability and potential support to surrounding regions.\n- **A BUL** to support **A RUM** or to move to Greece if it's not under a strong hold, to increase supply centers.\n- **A RUM** might support **A BUL** or potentially move into Ukraine if there is an opportunity.\n- **A PRU** can hold, anticipating potential conflict from Germany.\n- **F SKA** might support a move into Norway or Denmark, countering England's influence.\n\nBased on the strategic reasoning and the adjacent regions information available, here's the planning in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"F1909M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Defend key areas while looking for opportunities to expand into vulnerable or strategically important regions.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.

Recap and Analysis of Your Position:**\n\n- **Supply Centers Controlled:** BUL, RUM, and BUD.\n- **Units:** \n  - **A BUL** (Bulgaria)\n  - **A RUM** (Romania)\n  - **A PRU** (Prussia)\n\n### **2. Adjacent Regions to Consider for Moves or Support:**\n- **Bulgaria (BUL):**\n  - Land: RUM, SER, GRE\n  - Sea: CON via Fleet, which you do not have in Black Sea.\n\n- **Romania (RUM):**\n  - Land: UKR, GAL, BUD, SER, BUL\n  - Sea: BLA, which allows interaction with SEV, BUL/EC, CON.\n\n- **Prussia (PRU):**\n  - Land: BER, WAR, LVN, SIL\n  - Sea: BAL\n  \n### **3. Strategic Goals and Potential Orders:**\n\n**A. Holding and Expanding Territory:**\n- Focus on maintaining control of Bulgaria, Romania, and supporting nearby regions if necessary.\n\n**B. Possible Moves and Supports:**\n- **From Bulgaria (BUL):**\n  - Support action in Romania to strengthen hold on the region.\n  - Possible aggressive move towards Greece (GRE) to pressure Turkey and potentially capture a supply center next year.\n  - Support to Serbia (SER) if viable allies are present (check during negotiation phase).\n\n- **From Romania (RUM):**\n  - Support to Bulgaria from Romania can fortify your defensive line against Turkish or Austrian aggression.\n  - Consider moving to Budapest (BUD) to reconnect with Budapest if not currently held by Austria or any other threatening force.\n  - Supporting actions towards Ukraine (UKR) might be strategic if aiming to weaken Turkey further.\n\n- **From Prussia (PRU):**\n  - Support to Warsaw (WAR) to strengthen hold against potential German advancement.\n  - A move towards Berlin (BER) could be considered if it appears weakly defended and could represent a strategic gain.\n\n### **4. Specific Orders to Consider:**\n- **A BUL H** (Hold position in Bulgaria)\n- **A RUM S A BUL** (Support hold in Bulgaria from Romania)\n- **A PRU S A WAR** (Support hold in Warsaw from Prussia)\n\n### **5. Justification:**\n- The choice to hold Bulgaria is due to its strategic positioning and the risk of losing a supply center.\n- Supporting Bulgaria from Romania fortifies your hold, deterring immediate threats.\n- Supporting Warsaw from Prussia can help maintain influence and deter German expansion.\n\n### **Finalized Plan for Orders:**\n```json\n{\n    \"phase\": \"S1910M\",\n    \"reason\": \"Focus on maintaining control of key territories while preparing for potential expansions.

You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.\n1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.\n2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.\n3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: \n    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? \n    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? \n    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? \n    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! \n    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?\n    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.\n    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.\n    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.\n4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!\n5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, \n    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. \n    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers\n    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.\n    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. \n    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.\n    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.\n\nOnce you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n    \"phase\": \"current_phase\",\n    \"reason\": \"Your strategic reasoning here\",\n    \"my_location\": [\"PAR\", ...],\n    \"my_unit\": [\"BER\", ...],\n    \"adjacent\": [{\"PAR\": [\"BUR\", \"GAS\"]}, ...],\n    \"other_power_location\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"move_to_our_region_mask\": [0, 1, ...],\n    \"attackable\": [\"MUN\", ...],\n    \"attack_analysis\": [{\"MUN\": 2}, ...],\n    \"support_given\": [{\"supporter\": \"BUR\", \"supported\": \"PAR\", \"target\": \"PIC\"}, ...],\n    \"attack_mask\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [1, 0, ...],\n        ...\n    }\n    \"orders\": {\n        \"FRANCE\": [\"F BRE - MID\", \"A PAR - BUR\", ...],\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n### Instructions for the JSON object:\n\n1. **Reason:**\n   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the \"reason\" field.\n\n2. **Additional Fields:**\n\n   - **my_location:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).\n     - Example: `[\"MUN\", ...]`\n\n   - **my_unit:**\n     - A list of strings.\n     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.\n     - Example: `[\"BER\", ...]`\n\n   - **adjacent:**\n     - A list of dictionary.\n     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value.
