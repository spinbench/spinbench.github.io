</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "step_by_step_reasoning": "Your step by step reasoning here",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **step_by_step_reasoning:**
     - Provide your above step by step reasoning details in the "step_by_step_reasoning" field.

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>
{'RUSSIA': {'MOS': ['A MOS S A WAR - UKR', 'A MOS - LVN', 'A MOS S F SEV', 'A MOS - WAR', 'A MOS S A WAR - LVN', 'A MOS H', 'A MOS - SEV', 'A MOS - STP', 'A MOS S F STP/SC - LVN', 'A MOS - UKR', 'A MOS S F STP/SC', 'A MOS S A WAR'], 'SEV': ['F SEV S F ANK - ARM', 'F SEV S F ANK - BLA', 'F SEV H', 'F SEV - BLA', 'F SEV S A BUD - RUM', 'F SEV S A SMY - ARM', 'F SEV - ARM', 'F SEV - RUM'], 'STP': ['F STP/SC H', 'F STP/SC S A WAR - LVN', 'F STP/SC - LVN', 'F STP/SC - BOT', 'F STP/SC - FIN', 'F STP/SC S A MOS - LVN'], 'WAR': ['A WAR S F STP/SC - LVN', 'A WAR S A MOS - LVN', 'A WAR - LVN', 'A WAR S A MOS', 'A WAR - GAL', 'A WAR S A BER - SIL', 'A WAR H', 'A WAR - SIL', 'A WAR - UKR', 'A WAR S A MOS - UKR', 'A WAR S A BUD - GAL', 'A WAR S A MUN - SIL', 'A WAR - PRU', 'A WAR S A BER - PRU', 'A WAR - MOS', 'A WAR S A VIE - GAL']}}
</possible_orders>

Given the current situation as Russia in the Spring of 1901, here is a strategic plan based on the game's objectives and current state:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

**1. Analyzing Current State and Position:**
   - **Controlled Regions:** Moscow (MOS), Sevastopol (SEV), St. Petersburg South Coast (STP/SC), Warsaw (WAR)
   - **Units:** Army in Moscow, Fleet in Sevastopol, Fleet in St. Petersburg South Coast, Army in Warsaw.
   - **Adjacent Regions:** 
     - Moscow (MOS): [LVN, SEV, STP, UKR, WAR]
     - Sevastopol (SEV): [ARM, BLA, MOS, RUM, UKR]
     - Warsaw (WAR): [GAL, LVN, MOS, PRU, SIL, UKR]

**2. Objectives and Expansion Opportunities:**
   - **Immediate Targets for Expansion:** Ukraine (UKR), Livonia (LVN), Galicia (GAL)
   - **Reasoning:** Expanding towards Ukraine and Galicia provides a pathway towards more supply centers. Moving towards Livonia prepares for potential confrontations or alliances with Germany and opens paths to Scandinavia.

**3. Detailed Order Planning:**
   - **Moscow (MOS):**
     - Decision: Move Army Moscow to Ukraine.
     - Reasoning: Ukraine is a strategic point for expansion and is adjacent to Moscow.
   - **Sevastopol (SEV):**
     - Decision: Move Fleet Sevastopol to Rumania.
     - Reasoning: Rumania is an uncontrolled supply center and can be easily reached from Sevastopol, allowing extra build capabilities in the next year.
   - **St. Petersburg (STP/SC):**
     - Decision: Move Fleet St. Petersburg South Coast to Livonia.
     - Reasoning: Livonia connects to key strategic locations, including potential for further moves into Scandinavia or safeguarding northern territories.
   - **Warsaw (WAR):**
     - Decision: Move Army Warsaw to Galicia.
     - Reasoning: Galicia is a buffer zone against Austria and can be a point of negotiation or conflict; occupying it increases strategic positioning.

**4. Verification and Conflict Prediction:**
   - **Ukraine:** Movement to Ukraine from Moscow is unlikely to face immediate resistance. It’s a strategic depth expansion.
   - **Rumania:** As Sevastopol moves to Rumania, it should be unopposed and secures a new supply center.
   - **Livonia and Galicia:** These movements place forces near other powers, which may require subsequent diplomacy or support to maintain positions.

**5. Final Orders and Diplomatic Considerations:**
   - Continued engagement with neighboring powers, especially Turkey and Austria, to assess their movements and adjust strategies accordingly.
   - Keeping an eye on German movements, as the proximity poses both a threat and an opportunity for alliance.

A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.

     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

Let me analyze the situation step by step for ITALY and TURKEY:

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

0. Negotiation Recap:
   - No previous negotiation context is provided
   - Initial game state suggests a standard opening scenario

1. Current State Analysis:
   ITALY:
   - Control 3 home supply centers: NAP, ROM, VEN
   - Units: F NAP, A ROM, A VEN
   - Potential expansion targets: APU, TUS, TRI

   TURKEY:
   - Control 3 home supply centers: ANK, CON, SMY
   - Units: F ANK, A CON, A SMY
   - Potential expansion targets: BUL, ARM, SYR

2. Strategic Goals:
   - Expand control of supply centers
   - Seek opportunities for strategic positioning
   - Minimize potential counterattacks

3. Unit Analysis and Possible Moves:

   ITALY:
   - F NAP: Can move to APU, ROM, ION, TYS
   - A ROM: Can move to APU, VEN, TUS
   - A VEN: Can move to TRI, TYR, APU, PIE, TUS

   TURKEY:
   - F ANK: Can move to CON, BLA, ARM
   - A CON: Can move to BUL, SMY, ANK
   - A SMY: Can move to CON, ARM, SYR

4. Potential Strategic Moves:

   ITALY:
   - A VEN could potentially move to TRI (Austria's territory)
   - F NAP could support A ROM to APU
   - A ROM could potentially move to TUS

   TURKEY:
   - A CON could move to BUL
   - F ANK could support A SMY to ARM
   - A SMY could potentially move to SYR

5. Verification and Constraints:
   - Ensure moves are to adjacent regions
   - Verify potential support requirements
   - Avoid moving into own regions

6. Final Strategic Reasoning:
   ITALY's Goal: Expand into Austrian or French territories
   TURKEY's Goal: Secure Balkan and Middle Eastern regions

Based on this analysis, here's the strategic JSON:

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "step_by_step_reasoning": "Your step by step reasoning here",

     - Units: F EDI, F LON, A LVP
     - Controlled Supply Centers: EDI, LON, LVP

2. **Objective and Plan:**
   - **Austria:** Expand influence by pushing towards neutral and potentially vulnerable neighboring regions like Serbia (SER) and Galicia (GAL).
   - **England:** Secure North Sea (NTH) for future strategic movement and consider moving towards Norway (NWY).

3. **Possible Orders Analysis:**
   - **Austria:**
     - A BUD: Consider moving to neutral regions like SER or GAL.
     - F TRI: Consider moving to ALB or holding.
     - A VIE: Potentially move to GAL or observe a defensive posture.
   - **England:**
     - F EDI: Movement to NTH or NWG is strategically vital.
     - F LON: Direct move to NTH or support a move.
     - A LVP: Potential move towards YOR or CLY.

4. **Order Decisions:**
   - **Austria:**
     - A BUD - SER: Expanding towards a neutral supply center.
     - F TRI - ALB: Move to secure a southern position for future support.
     - A VIE - GAL: Movement to assert influence in the north and counter potential threats.
   - **England:**
     - F EDI - NTH: Secure the strategically important North Sea.
     - F LON - ENG: Move to position for future actions.
     - A LVP - YOR: Move towards YOR for potential support in future phases.

5. **Verification and Revision:**
   - Ensure that each move is towards an adjacent and strategic location.
   - Confirm that moves align with the overall strategy of expansion and securing key positions.

There are no neutral powers in this game.

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'BRE': ['ENG', 'GAS', 'MAO', 'PAR', 'PIC']}, {'MAR': ['BUR', 'gas', 'LYO', 'PIE', 'SPA/SC', 'SWI']}, {'PAR': ['BUR', 'BRE', 'GAS', 'PIC']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "step_by_step_reasoning": "Your step by step reasoning here",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],

        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **step_by_step_reasoning:**
     - Provide your above step by step reasoning details in the "step_by_step_reasoning" field.

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>
{'FRANCE': {'BRE': ['F BRE - MAO', 'F BRE - GAS', 'F BRE H', 'F BRE S A PAR - GAS', 'F BRE S F LON - ENG', 'F BRE S A PAR - PIC', 'F BRE - PIC', 'F BRE S A MAR - GAS', 'F BRE - ENG'], 'MAR': ['A MAR - SPA', 'A MAR S F BRE - GAS', 'A MAR S A MUN - BUR', 'A MAR - BUR', 'A MAR - GAS', 'A MAR - PIE', 'A MAR S A VEN - PIE', 'A MAR S A PAR - BUR', 'A MAR H', 'A MAR S A PAR - GAS'], 'PAR': ['A PAR - BRE', 'A PAR S A MUN - BUR', 'A PAR - PIC', 'A PAR S A MAR - GAS', 'A PAR S F BRE', 'A PAR S A MAR - BUR', 'A PAR S F BRE - GAS', 'A PAR S F BRE - PIC', 'A PAR - BUR', 'A PAR H', 'A PAR - GAS']}}
</possible_orders>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region.

     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

Considering the game phase 'F1901M' and the current strategic landscape for Russia, here's a focused analysis and strategic plan:

**Strategic Analysis:**

1. **Current Position**: Russia controls Moscow, Sevastopol, St. Petersburg, Warsaw, Ukraine, Rumania, and Livonia. 
   
2. **Objective**: As Russia, my aim is to secure more supply centers while defending my current assets. Key territories for potential expansion include Scandinavia (particularly Norway), the Balkans, and potentially pressuring Turkey via the Black Sea.

3. **Potential Actions**:
   - **Norway**: A viable target given its proximity to St. Petersburg and the relatively open nature of Scandinavia in the early game.
   - **Balkans**: Engaging here might be too aggressive towards Austria and Turkey early on, risking my southern flank.
   - **Black Sea**: Essential to control if a conflict with Turkey is anticipated.

4. **Unit Analysis and Orders**:
   - **Fleet in Livonia (F LVN)**: With options to move into Baltic areas, a strategic choice is moving towards Sweden or supporting actions in Prussia. However, moving into Sweden directly threatens Germany and might provoke England as well.
   - **Fleet in Rumania (F RUM)**: Holding in Rumania is stable, but moving into the Black Sea could provide strategic leverage over Turkey.
   - **Army in Ukraine (A UKR)**: Central and can support actions in Rumania or move towards more aggressive stances like attacking Galicia or supporting in Sevastopol.
   - **Army in Warsaw (A WAR)**: Can either move towards Silesia to threaten Germany or support eastern actions towards Galicia.

**Proposed Orders**:
Given these considerations, the following orders might balance expansion with defense:

1. **F LVN - BAL**: Fleet in Livonia moves to the Baltic Sea to exert pressure on Scandinavian and German territories.
2. **F RUM - BLA**: Fleet in Rumania moves to the Black Sea, opening options against Turkey and securing southern defenses.
3. **A UKR - RUM**: Army in Ukraine moves to Rumania, possibly preparing for further Balkan engagements or fortifying positions against potential Balkan hostilities.
4. **A WAR - GAL**: Army in Warsaw moves to Galicia to challenge Austrian influence and expand Russian control in the Balkans.

**Strategic Reasoning**:
- **Northern Expansion**: By moving the Livonian fleet to the Baltic Sea, there is an implied threat to both Sweden and potentially Berlin, spreading defensive focus of Germany and possibly England, aiding in indirect Russian strategies.
- **Southern Strategy**: Moving into the Black Sea and reinforcing Rumania creates a dual threat towards Turkey, either diplomatically inducing caution or preparing for military engagements.
- **Central Pressure**: Moving into Galicia challenges Austria directly, which could either lead to early concessions or a strong defensive pact—both of which need to be diplomatically navigated but could result in strategic gains.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "step_by_step_reasoning": "Your step by step reasoning here",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **step_by_step_reasoning:**
     - Provide your above step by step reasoning details in the "step_by_step_reasoning" field.

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>

Let me analyze the situation step by step for Italy and Turkey:

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Current State Analysis:
- Italy: 3 supply centers (NAP, ROM, VEN)
  - Units: F NAP, A APU, A TRI
- Turkey: 3 supply centers (ANK, CON, SMY)
  - Units: F ANK, A BUL, A ARM

2. Strategic Position:
- Italy's units are clustered in the Adriatic/Ionian region
- Turkey's units are positioned around the Black Sea and Balkans
- Both powers have potential expansion opportunities

3. Potential Moves:
Italy:
- A APU could move to VEN or support an attack
- A TRI is in a strategic position to potentially attack Austria
- F NAP could support movement or threaten Mediterranean routes

Turkey:
- A ARM could potentially move towards Sevastopol
- F ANK could support Black Sea movements
- A BUL is in a good position to influence Balkan movements

4. Strategic Objectives:
- Expand control of supply centers
- Create strategic pressure on neighboring powers
- Prepare for potential future collaborations/conflicts

5. Proposed Orders:

Italy:
- A APU - VEN (expand control, potential pressure on Austria)
- A TRI - SER (attempt to gain new supply center)
- F NAP H (maintain defensive position)

Turkey:
- A ARM - SEV (attempt to capture Russian supply center)
- F ANK - BLA (control Black Sea)
- A BUL - RUM (expand control, potential Russian conflict)

Detailed Strategic Reasoning:
- Both powers are making aggressive moves to expand territory
- Targeting potentially vulnerable supply centers
- Creating pressure on Austria and Russia
- Maintaining flexibility for future diplomatic negotiations

    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **step_by_step_reasoning:**
     - Provide your above step by step reasoning details in the "step_by_step_reasoning" field.

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Sure, let's analyze the situation step by step and make strategic decisions for both Austria and England.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

0. **Negotiation Recap:** 
   - As this is a theoretical exercise and no prior negotiation details are provided, I'll base my strategy on typical opening moves and strategic objectives for Austria and England.

1. **Game State Analysis:**
   - **Austria:**
     - Units: A VIE, A SER, F ALB
     - Controlled Supply Centers: BUD, TRI, VIE
     - Strategic Position: Austria is typically in a central position and needs to secure its borders while looking for opportunities to expand into the Balkans or Italy.
   - **England:**
     - Units: F NTH, F ENG, A YOR
     - Controlled Supply Centers: EDI, LON, LVP
     - Strategic Position: England is a maritime power and should focus on securing naval dominance while potentially expanding into nearby territories like Belgium or Norway.

2. **Objective Planning:**
   - **Austria:** 
     - Goal is to secure the Balkans and potentially move towards Italy or Germany.
     - Immediate target is the nearby weakly held territories like Greece (GRE) or Bulgarian (BUL).
   - **England:**
     - Goal is to assert control over the English Channel and North Sea areas, possibly targeting Belgium (BEL) or Norway (NWY).
     - Immediate target could be either an expansion to Belgium or a strategic hold over the English Channel.

3. **Possible Orders Analysis:**

   - **Austria:**
     - **F ALB:** Possible moves include holding, moving to nearby sea zones, or supporting land units. Moving to GRE could be advantageous.
     - **A SER:** Can support moves or movements to adjacent territories like BUL or GRE. An aggressive move to BUL can challenge Turkey's southern position.
     - **A VIE:** Could support or attack nearby regions, but holding or moving to prepare for future aggression or defense could be wise.

   - **England:**
     - **F ENG:** Could assert control over the Channel or assist in an attack. Supporting a landing in BEL or solidifying the sea positions can be strategic.
     - **F NTH:** Could support moves into BEL or NWY, offering options for continental influence.
     - **A YOR:** Could move to LON for defense or attempt a move via convoy to continental Europe.

   Let's decide on the most logical actions for our units:

### Strategic Decisions

- **Austria:**
  - **F ALB - GRE:** Move the fleet from Albania to Greece to secure a potential supply center.
  - **A SER - BUL:** Move to Bulgaria to challenge Turkey for control.
  - **A VIE S A SER - BUL:** Support the move from Serbia to Bulgaria to ensure its success.

- **England:**
  - **F ENG - BEL:** Move the fleet to support an army into Belgium.
  - **F NTH - NWY:** Move to Norway to expand England's influence.
  - **A YOR - LON:** Secure London to maintain strategic defense and prepare for future naval moves.

### Verification and Revision

- Checked the adjacency rules to ensure all moves are valid and supportive moves are within range.
- Ensured attack targets are not currently controlled.
- Verified that all orders align with the goal of securing more supply centers.

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

    "phase": "current_phase",
    "step_by_step_reasoning": "Your step by step reasoning here",

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'BAL': ['BER', 'BOT', 'DEN', 'LVN', 'KIE', 'PRU', 'SWE']}, {'GAL': ['BOH', 'BUD', 'RUM', 'SIL', 'UKR', 'VIE', 'WAR']}, {'RUM': ['BLA', 'BUD', 'BUL/EC', 'GAL', 'SER', 'SEV', 'UKR']}, {'UKR': ['GAL', 'MOS', 'RUM', 'SEV', 'WAR']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "step_by_step_reasoning": "Your step by step reasoning here",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],

        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **step_by_step_reasoning:**
     - Provide your above step by step reasoning details in the "step_by_step_reasoning" field.

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

As Russia in the Diplomacy game, here is the strategic plan for the Spring 1902 Movement phase based on the current game state and the units' positioning:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning and Analysis

1. **Current Position Analysis:**
   - **Controlled Regions:** WAR, MOS, STP, UKR, RUM, SEV, GAL, BAL
   - **Units:** Army in UKR, GAL; Fleet in BAL, RUM
   - **Supply Centers:** MOS, STP, WAR, RUM 

2. **Strategic Goals:**
   - **Expand Influence:** Looking to expand into nearby regions while ensuring the defense of existing territories and supply centers.
   - **Target Regions for Attack:** Based on adjacency, potential targets include SEV, BLA, and targeting BUL through fleet movements to undermine Turkish control.
   - **Defense Strategy:** Safeguard RUM and SEV from potential threats by Turkey. 

3. **Detailed Unit Orders:**
   - **Fleet in BAL:**
     - Mainly will focus on supporting nearby army movements or hold its ground to safeguard the northern flank.
   - **Army in GAL:**
     - Positioned well to support movements into RUM or hold to protect against aggression from Austria or Turkey.
   - **Fleet in RUM:**
     - Key to exerting pressure on Black Sea territories, can support SEV or attack Turkish controlled BUL.
   - **Army in UKR:**
     - Central to supporting defensive or offensive operations into RUM or SEV, depending on Turkish movements.

4. **Support and Attack Prioritization:**
   - Support from GAL and UKR critical for maintaining pressure and defending RUM.
   - Support from BAL can either go towards reinforcing positions in GAL or to assist movements from RUM.

5. **Verification and Final Order Selection:**
   - Need to ensure that each order maximizes both offensive posture for gaining supply centers and defensive strategies to protect crucial regions.

    ]
  }
}
```

This strategic plan aims to consolidate Russian control while preparing for further territorial gains, particularly against Turkish forces in the Black Sea region. The fleet in BAL holds its position to protect the north, while coordinated support from GAL and UKR is critical for either defending or counter-attacking in the south against Turkish movements.

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

I'll analyze the game state step by step for Italy and Turkey:

## Italy Strategic Analysis
1. Current State:
- Controlled Supply Centers: NAP, ROM, VEN, TRI (4 centers)
- Units: F NAP, F ROM, A TRI, A VEN
- Potential Expansion Targets: APU, TYR, PIE, TUS

2. Strategic Goals:
- Expand territorial control
- Potentially challenge Austria-Hungary's nearby regions
- Secure strategic positioning in the Mediterranean

## Turkey Strategic Analysis
1. Current State:
- Controlled Supply Centers: ANK, CON, SMY, SEV, BUL (5 centers)
- Units: F ANK, F CON, A SMY, A SEV, A BUL
- Potential Expansion Targets: ARM, RUM, GRE, SER

2. Strategic Goals:
- Consolidate Balkan and Black Sea influence
- Potentially challenge Russia or Austria-Hungary
- Maintain strong defensive positioning

## Combined Strategic Reasoning
The combined strategy will focus on:
- Probing potential weaknesses in Austria-Hungary's territory
- Securing Mediterranean and Black Sea regions
- Creating strategic pressure without overextending

## Detailed Order Planning

### Italy Orders
- A VEN → PIE (Expand westward)
- A TRI → VIE (Challenge Austria's home center)
- F NAP → ION (Prepare Mediterranean expansion)
- F ROM H (Defensive positioning)

### Turkey Orders
- A BUL → RUM (Expand into potential Russian territory)
- A SEV → UKR (Challenge Russian positioning)
- F ANK → BLA (Secure Black Sea)
- A SMY → ARM (Expand eastward)
- F CON H (Defensive positioning)

Now, I'll construct the JSON object with this analysis:

            "F CON H"
        ]
    }
}
```

This strategy aims to create pressure on multiple fronts while maintaining defensive positions. The moves challenge Austria-Hungary and Russia's territories, potentially disrupting their expansion and creating opportunities for Italy and Turkey to gain more supply centers.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "step_by_step_reasoning": "Your step by step reasoning here",

Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Alright, let's walk through the step-by-step process to formulate a set of strategic orders for the Spring 1902 Move phase.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

0. **Recap of Negotiation Phase:** Being aware that no specific details from the negotiation phase have been provided, it is critical to utilize current map information and existing alliances or diplomatic interactions.

1. **State Analysis:**
   - **Austria:** Controls BUD, VIE, SER, and GRE with units in VIE, SER, F GRE, and A BUD. Currently, there is no immediate threat nearby, but there's potential for expansion or strengthening borders.
   - **England:** Controls EDI, LON, LVP, NWY with units in F ENG, F NWY, A LON, and F LVP. Focus should be on securing additional supply centers in nearby territories.

2. **Strategic Goals:**
   - **Austria:** Defend current supply centers while looking for opportunities to push into Balkan regions like RUM or BUL, or north into GAL.
   - **England:** Secure dominance in the North Sea, potentially support actions against Germany or France, and aim for additional coastal territories like BEL or BRE.

3. **Possible Orders Analysis:**
   - **Austria:**
     - **A BUD:** Consider supporting SER or neighboring units, or move to RUM.
     - **F GRE:** Potential move into BUL or securing ALB for future moves.
     - **A SER:** Can support defensive or offensive positions towards RUM, BUL, or TRI.
     - **A VIE:** Can provide support or try to solidify positions.
   - **England:**
     - **F ENG:** Possible strategic moves to NTH or BEL, or supporting surrounding fleets.
     - **A LON:** Move to WAL for potential future support to F ENG.
     - **F LVP:** Cover IRI or move to NAO.
     - **F NWY:** Secure NTH and potentially threaten SWE.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Focus on ensuring enough support for any aggressive actions to prevent bounce backs.
   - Take care not to expose vital supply centers to potential counter-attacks.

5. **Verification of Actions:**
   - Ensure all moves are legal in terms of adjacency and feasible in strategy.
   - Validate that all potential attacks provide more support than defending units.

  }
}

### Explanation:
- For Austria, the focus is to solidify and potentially expand control in eastern Europe by moving into RUM and BUL.
- England focuses its naval powers on gaining control over the North Sea and adjacent areas, while simultaneously repositioning troops to prepare for future maneuvers.
- All moves aim to consolidate and expand territorial influence while ensuring adequate support to safeguard against counter-moves.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "step_by_step_reasoning": "Your step by step reasoning here",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **step_by_step_reasoning:**
     - Provide your above step by step reasoning details in the "step_by_step_reasoning" field.

     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'BER': ['BAL', 'KIE', 'MUN', 'PRU', 'SIL']}, {'HOL': ['BEL', 'HEL', 'KIE', 'NTH', 'RUH']}, {'KIE': ['BAL', 'BER', 'DEN', 'HEL', 'HOL', 'MUN', 'RUH']}, {'RUH': ['BEL', 'BUR', 'HOL', 'KIE', 'MUN']}, {'SWE': ['BAL', 'BOT', 'DEN', 'FIN', 'NWY', 'SKA']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>
{'GERMANY': {'BER': ['A BER - KIE', 'A BER - PRU VIA', 'A BER S A GAL - SIL', 'A BER - SIL', 'A BER S A RUH - KIE', 'A BER S A RUH - MUN', 'A BER - KIE VIA', 'A BER - LVN VIA', 'A BER - PRU', 'A BER - SWE VIA', 'A BER S F BAL - PRU', 'A BER - MUN', 'A BER H', 'A BER S F BAL - KIE', 'A BER - DEN VIA', 'A BER S F KIE', 'A BER S A HOL - KIE'], 'HOL': ['A HOL S A RUH - KIE', 'A HOL - BEL', 'A HOL S A RUH - BEL', 'A HOL S A RUH', 'A HOL H', 'A HOL S F BAL - KIE', 'A HOL - RUH', 'A HOL S A POR - BEL', 'A HOL S A BER - KIE', 'A HOL S A LON - BEL', 'A HOL S F KIE', 'A HOL S F ENG - BEL', 'A HOL - KIE', 'A HOL S A BRE - BEL'], 'KIE': ['F KIE S F BAL - BER', 'F KIE - BAL', 'F KIE S F SWE - BAL', 'F KIE H', 'F KIE S A BER - DEN', 'F KIE S F BAL - DEN', 'F KIE - BER', 'F KIE - HEL', 'F KIE S A RUH - HOL', 'F KIE - HOL', 'F KIE S A HOL', 'F KIE S A BER', 'F KIE S F SWE - DEN', 'F KIE S F BAL', 'F KIE - DEN'], 'RUH': ['A RUH S A LON - BEL', 'A RUH S F BAL - KIE', 'A RUH - HOL', 'A RUH S A HOL', 'A RUH S A HOL - BEL', 'A RUH S A BRE - BEL', 'A RUH H', 'A RUH S A BER - KIE', 'A RUH S A HOL - KIE', 'A RUH S F KIE', 'A RUH S F KIE - HOL', 'A RUH - BEL', 'A RUH S A BER - MUN', 'A RUH S F ENG - BEL', 'A RUH S A PAR - BUR', 'A RUH - MUN', 'A RUH S A POR - BEL', 'A RUH - KIE', 'A RUH - BUR'], 'SWE': ['F SWE S F BAL - BOT', 'F SWE S F KIE - BAL', 'F SWE S F BAL', 'F SWE H', 'F SWE S A BER - DEN', 'F SWE S F NWY', 'F SWE S F KIE - DEN', 'F SWE S F BAL - DEN', 'F SWE - FIN', 'F SWE - BOT', 'F SWE - DEN', 'F SWE - BAL', 'F SWE S F NWY - SKA', 'F SWE - NWY', 'F SWE - SKA']}}

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

Given the current state of the game as Russia in the Spring of 1902, with the units and their positions along with the objectives and rules of the game, here is the strategic plan:

### Strategic Reasoning:
As Russia, we currently control a strong presence in both northern and southern parts of the map with units in key strategic areas. Our primary goal is to expand our influence to nearby supply centers while defending the ones we already hold. Given our geographical disposition, we have an opportunity to exert pressure on Austria and Turkey, both of whom share borders with our units. 

Our units are strategically placed to either support each other or make significant movements. The Fleet in Rumania (RUM) can exert naval influence in the Black Sea, potentially cutting off Turkish movements and supply lines. Our army in Galicia (GAL) can either move to support operations against Austria or defend against incoming threats. Our Army in Ukraine (UKR) can support movements towards Rumania or defend against any potential threats from the south. The Fleet in Baltic Sea (BAL) can support movements in northern Europe or help defend our interests against German advances.

### Objective and Orders:

1. **Objective with the Fleet in Rumania (RUM):** Aim to control the Black Sea to disrupt Turkish fleets and their convoy routes. This could leave Turkey vulnerable and unable to support their armies effectively.

2. **Objective with the Army in Galicia (GAL):** Prepare to support a potential move against Austria or defend against Austrian aggression. Flexibility here is key depending on Austria's moves.

3. **Objective with the Army in Ukraine (UKR):** Enhance defensive posture around Rumania and potentially support an advance into Rumania if Austria weakens their hold.

4. **Objective with the Fleet in Baltic Sea (BAL):** Utilize to support actions against Germany or defend Russian territories against German naval movements.

### Reasoning Validation:
- All moves align with the objective of territorial expansion or defense.
- Ensured that all targets for attacks are not currently controlled by Russia and that they are adjacent to the attacking units.
- Confirmed that each support move matches the adjacent regions and the support is correctly directed towards valid moves.

### Proposed Orders for Russia:

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'NAP': ['APU', 'ION', 'ROM', 'TYS']}, {'ROM': ['apu', 'NAP', 'TUS', 'TYS', 'ven']}, {'TRI': ['ADR', 'ALB', 'BUD', 'SER', 'TYR', 'VEN', 'VIE']}, {'VEN': ['ADR', 'APU', 'pie', 'rom', 'TRI', 'tus', 'TYR']}, {'ANK': ['ARM', 'BLA', 'CON', 'smy']}, {'CON': ['AEG', 'BUL/EC', 'BUL/SC', 'BLA', 'ANK', 'SMY']}, {'SEV': ['ARM', 'BLA', 'MOS', 'RUM', 'UKR']}, {'SMY': ['AEG', 'ank', 'arm', 'CON', 'EAS', 'SYR']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

4. Strategic Considerations:
   - Italy could potentially attack Austria (BUD, VIE)
   - Turkey could expand into Russian or Austrian territories
   - Coordination between Italy and Turkey could be beneficial

5. Proposed Strategy:
   ITALY:
   - A TRI to move towards SER to challenge Austria
   - F NAP to support potential expansion
   - A VEN to prepare for potential expansion

   TURKEY:
   - A BUL to move to RUM, challenging Russian influence
   - F CON to support BUL's move
   - A SEV to support the RUM expansion

Here's the JSON representation of the strategy:

            "F ANK H",
            "A SMY H"
        ]
    }
}
```

Key strategic points:
1. Italy attempts to move into SER with support from F NAP
2. Turkey moves A BUL to RUM with support from F CON and A SEV
3. Defensive holds for other units to maintain current positions
4. Potential to weaken Austria and Russia

The strategy aims to expand territorial control while minimizing direct conflict with immediate neighbors.

    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let's work through the following steps to issue orders for the powers under your control (Austria and England).

## Step-by-Step Analysis

0. **Recap of Negotiation Phase:** There is no direct information from the previous negotiation phase, so we have to rely on current board positions and assume the typical early-game strategies.

1. **Current State Analysis:**
   - **Austria:**
     - Units: A VIE, A SER, F GRE, A BUD
     - Supply Centers: BUD, VIE, GRE, SER
     - Influence: BUD, VIE, SER, ALB, GRE
   - **England:**
     - Units: F ENG, F NWY, A LON, F LVP
     - Supply Centers: EDI, LON, LVP, NWY
     - Influence: EDI, LVP, NTH, ENG, YOR, NWY, LON

2. **Goal and Strategy:**
   - **Austria:**
     - Potential Expansion Areas: RUM, TRI (attempt to regain), ALB
     - Strategy: Strengthen control over the Balkans and counter threats from Italy and Turkey.
   - **England:**
     - Potential Expansion Areas: PYI, BRE, BEL
     - Strategy: Secure naval dominance in the North Sea and expand into France or Germany.

3. **Possible Orders Analysis:**

   ### **Austria's Orders:**

   - **A VIE**:
     - Possible Targets: BUD (support), TRI (attack), GAL (attack)
     - Recommendation: Support TRI to BUL or attack TRI. Strengthening the hold or retaking TRI is strategic.
   
   - **A SER**:
     - Possible Targets: GRE (attack), ALB (attack), RUM (attack)
     - Recommendation: Support GRE or move to ALB, depending on perceived threats from Turkey or Italy.
   
   - **F GRE**:
     - Possible Targets: AEG, ALB (attack or support), BUL/SC
     - Recommendation: Move to ALB or AEG to exert naval pressure.

   - **A BUD**:
     - Possible Targets: VIE, RUM
     - Recommendation: Support VIE if attacking TRI or hold to defend against potential Russian advances.

   ### **England's Orders:**

   - **F ENG**:
     - Possible Targets: IRI, BRE, BEL, MAO
     - Recommendation: Move to MAO or support offensive operations against France.

   - **F NWY**:
     - Possible Targets: SKA, SWE, STP/NC
     - Recommendation: Move to SKA for strategic positioning, or support other operations.
   
   - **A LON**:
     - Possible Targets: WAL, YOR
     - Recommendation: Support movement of fleets or hold, depending on naval maneuvers.

   - **F LVP**:
     - Possible Targets: WAL, IRI, NAO
     - Recommendation: Move to IRI to open up more options or provide support where necessary.

4. **Order Decisions:**

Given the analysis and our goals, let's choose the strategic orders for each unit.

5. **Verification and Finalization:**
   - Ensure that no moves are into our own regions unless strategically necessary for positioning.
   - Make sure attacks and supports are accurately calculated.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",

     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Given the current state of the game and the positions of my units as Russia, I have to carefully plan my moves to maximize both my defenses and my opportunities for expansion. Here is the analysis based on the game situation:

### Strategic Analysis and Justification:

- **Positional Analysis:**
  I control significant territories in the eastern and northern parts of the map, including Moscow, St. Petersburg, Warsaw, Ukraine, Galicia, Rumania, and the Baltic and Black Seas. This gives me a strong position to influence both the northern and southern strategies.

- **Expansion Opportunities:**
  My immediate targets for expansion should be controlling more supply centers. Norway, currently under English control, is an attractive target considering my fleet in the Baltic Sea. Additionally, expanding further into the Balkans by moving into Austria-Hungary territories like Budapest through Galicia might be a viable option. Furthermore, solidifying control over the Black Sea region is crucial, which may entail dislodging Turkish forces in Ankara or Constantinople.

- **Defense Concerns:**
  Turkey appears as a direct threat in the south, holding positions close to my territories like Sevastopol. Defending Rumania and potentially reinforcing it from surrounding units in Ukraine or Galicia is a priority.

### Proposed Orders and Rationale:
- **Fleet Baltic Sea (BAL):**
  - Move BAL to Sweden (SWE) to build pressure against English and German naval units and position myself closer to potentially critical regions like Norway in the future. (`F BAL - SWE`)

- **Fleet Black Sea (BLA):**
  - Support hold in Rumania from Black Sea to prevent any surprise moves by the Turks. This move ensures that my hold in the Black Sea remains robust. (`F BLA S A RUM`)

- **Army Galicia (GAL):**
  - Support attack on Budapest from Ukraine, coordinating with the unit in Ukraine to potentially displace Austrian forces and gain a critical supply center in the heart of Europe. (`A GAL S A UKR - BUD`)

- **Army Ukraine (UKR):**
  - Attack Budapest. This move is supported by Galicia, increasing the chances of success and allowing expansion into a critical Austrian territory. (`A UKR - BUD`)

These moves are designed to balance between expansion and defense, maximizing the strategic use of each unit while preparing for potential counter-moves by opponents.

This plan uses my fleets to exert naval pressure and secure strategic sea regions while coordinating land units for a decisive push into Central Europe, leveraging support to ensure successful attacks and holds.

    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let me analyze the game state step by step:

0. Negotiation Phase Recap:
   - No specific negotiation details were provided in the initial setup.

1. Current Game State Analysis:
   - Italy's Current Situation:
     * Controlling 4 supply centers: NAP, ROM, VEN, TRI
     * Units: F NAP, F ROM, A VEN, A SER
     * Strategic Position: Relatively stable, but limited expansion opportunities

   - Potential Targets:
     * Austria (nearby and potentially vulnerable)
     * Turkey (could be an interesting expansion target)

2. Strategic Objectives:
   - Expand control of supply centers
   - Weaken nearby powers
   - Secure strategic positions

3. Unit Analysis:
   - F NAP: Potential moves to APU or ION
   - F ROM: Could support moves or threaten TUS
   - A VEN: Potential move to TRI or PIE
   - A SER: Flexible position, can support various moves

4. Detailed Order Considerations:
   4.1 Potential Attacks:
       - A VEN could potentially attack TRI (Austrian territory)
       - A SER could potentially move to TRI or support an attack
       - F NAP could support movements

   4.2 Support Opportunities:
       - A SER can provide support to various moves
       - F ROM can support coastal movements

5. Strategic Reasoning:
   - Aim to weaken Austria by pressuring TRI
   - Create opportunities for expansion
   - Maintain defensive positions

Based on this analysis, here's my proposed strategy:

{
    "phase": "F1902M",
    "reason": "Strategically positioning to pressure Austria and create expansion opportunities in the Balkan region",
    "my_location": ["NAP", "ROM", "VEN", "TRI", "SER"],
    "my_unit": ["F NAP", "F ROM", "A VEN", "A SER"],
    "adjacent": [
        {"NAP": ["APU", "ION", "ROM", "TYS"]},
        {"ROM": ["APU", "NAP", "TUS", "TYS", "VEN"]},
        {"VEN": ["ADR", "APU", "PIE", "ROM", "TRI", "TUS", "TYR"]},
        {"SER": ["ALB", "BUD", "BUL", "GRE", "RUM", "TRI"]}
    ],
    "other_power_location": ["TRI", "BUD"],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 0, 0, 0],
    "attackable": ["TRI", "BUD"],
    "attack_analysis": [
        {"TRI": 2},
        {"BUD": 3}
    ],
    "support_given": [
        {"supporter": "A SER", "supported": "A VEN", "target": "TRI"},
        {"supporter": "F ROM", "supported": "A VEN", "target": "TRI"}
    ],
    "attack_mask": {
        "ITALY": [1, 0, 1, 0]
    },
    "orders": {
        "ITALY": [
            "A VEN - TRI",
            "F ROM H",
            "A SER S A VEN - TRI",
            "F NAP - ION"
        ]
    }
}

Key Strategic Moves:
1. A VEN attacks TRI with support from A SER
2. F ROM holds to maintain position
3. F NAP moves to ION to create strategic flexibility
4. A SER supports the attack on TRI

The strategy aims to:
- Pressure Austria by attacking TRI
- Potentially weaken Austrian position
- Create opportunities for future expansion
- Maintain defensive positioning

The attack on TRI has support from both A VEN and A SER, increasing chances of success.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",

     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let's analyze the current state and devise a strategic plan step by step:

### Step 0: Recap Negotiations

There are no notes provided regarding the negotiation phase, so we will proceed under the assumption that there are no binding agreements or promises that significantly alter our strategy.

### Step 1: Analyze Current State

- **Austria:**
  - **Units:** A BUD, A TRI, A ALB, F AEG
  - **Supply Centers:** BUD, VIE, GRE, SER
  - **Influence:** BUD, VIE, GRE, TRI, ALB, AEG

- **England:**
  - **Units:** F NWY, A LON, F MAO, F IRI
  - **Supply Centers:** EDI, LON, LVP, NWY
  - **Influence:** EDI, LVP, NTH, ENG, YOR, NWY, LON, MAO, IRI

### Step 2: Plan to Take More Supply Centers

- **Austria:**
  - Potential targets include Bulgaria (either coast) and Greece, focusing on consolidating control in the Balkans and Eastern Mediterranean.
  
- **England:**
  - Consider reinforcing control in Scandinavia and potentially expanding influence in the Atlantic or capturing nearby French territories such as Brest.

### Step 3: Analyze Possible Orders for Each Unit

- **Austria:**

  - **F AEG:** Consider moving to Aegean Sea regions or supporting moves in Eastern Europe.
  - **A ALB:** Primed for moves into Serbia or defense of Albania.
  - **A BUD:** Strategic moves into Galicia, Rumania, or holding the line.
  - **A TRI:** Could move into enemy regions such as Venice or defend Trieste.

- **England:**

  - **F IRI:** Possibly moving towards the North Atlantic or supporting moves against French territories.
  - **A LON:** Can move towards Wales or Yorkshire.
  - **F MAO:** Likely candidate for forward movement into the Western Mediterranean or Bay of Biscay.
  - **F NWY:** Consider moves supporting the hold on Norway or moving into adjacent seas for strategic positioning.

### Step 4-5: Make Order Decisions and Verify

Let's finalize the orders and verify them against our goals.

### Explanation:

- **Austria:**
  - **A BUD - RUM:** Aimed at weakening Russian influence and gaining a strategic position.
  - **A TRI - VEN:** Possible attack on Italy, aiming to weaken their positions.
  - **A ALB - GRE:** Attempting to gain control of Greece.
  - **F AEG S A ALB - GRE:** Supporting the move into Greece.

- **England:**
  - **F IRI - MAO:** Possibility to reinforce positions and threaten France.
  - **A LON - YOR:** Defensive and strategic positioning.
  - **F MAO - BRE:** Attempt to gain a foothold in France.
  - **F NWY - STP/NC:** Strategic move towards Russian territory in Scandinavia. 

This setup leverages Austria's position in the Balkans and seeks to disrupt both Italian and Russian positions while strengthening England's hold in the west and north.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],

     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

There are no neutral powers in this game.
This is the build/disband phase. You can build new units in your home centers, or disband units if you have too many. Remember, you need to control enough supply centers to win.

Please respond with a JSON object like:
{
"reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
"orders": {
    "FRANCE": ["F BRE B", "A PAR B", ...],
    ...
}
}

Where "orders" is a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of each location's decision. For each location, you can only issue one order. The length of the list of each power should match the number of locations for which you can issue orders.

The string should be able to be parsed to json str. So don't use special characters like \n, \t, etc. Generate the text with standard straight double quotes. Do not add comments inside the output! 
The possible orders you can issue are as follows:
{'FRANCE': {}}
Remember, you need to reach the configured number of supply centers (build more and more supply centers) to win.

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'BEL': ['BUR', 'ENG', 'HOL', 'NTH', 'PIC', 'RUH']}, {'BUR': ['BEL', 'GAS', 'RUH', 'MAR', 'MUN', 'PAR', 'PIC', 'SWI']}, {'HOL': ['BEL', 'HEL', 'KIE', 'NTH', 'RUH']}, {'KIE': ['BAL', 'BER', 'DEN', 'HEL', 'HOL', 'MUN', 'RUH']}, {'NTH': ['BEL', 'DEN', 'EDI', 'ENG', 'LON', 'HEL', 'HOL', 'NWY', 'NWG', 'SKA', 'YOR']}, {'NWY': ['BAR', 'fin', 'NTH', 'NWG', 'SKA', 'STP/NC', 'SWE']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

[{'GAL': ['BOH', 'BUD', 'RUM', 'SIL', 'UKR', 'VIE', 'WAR']}, {'SWE': ['BAL', 'BOT', 'DEN', 'FIN', 'NWY', 'SKA']}, {'UKR': ['GAL', 'MOS', 'RUM', 'SEV', 'WAR']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",

If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**

     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**

Given the state of the game as Russia in 'S1903M' and analyzing the current positions and possibilities, here is the strategic reasoning and orders:

## Strategic Reasoning

As Russia, controlling supply centers such as Moscow, Warsaw, and Sweden gives me a strong position in the north and east of Europe. My current units are positioned in Galicia, Ukraine, and Sweden, providing a mix of strategic offensive and defensive opportunities. Given the locations of other powers, particularly the proximity of Turkey and Austria which are traditional threats to Russian interests in the area, my strategy will focus on solidifying control and preparing for expansion.

1. **Galicia (A GAL)**:
    - Positioned between key areas including Budapest, Vienna, and Rumania.
    - Offers potential support roles or direct moves into Austria or Rumania, depending on the vulnerability and diplomatic status with neighbors.

2. **Sweden (F SWE)**:
    - A fleet in Sweden allows control over the northern seas (Baltic Sea and Norwegian Sea) and can support moves into Norway or Denmark if necessary.
    - Can be used defensively to hold Sweden or support nearby territories like St. Petersburg or Norway against possible English or German advances.

3. **Ukraine (A UKR)**:
    - Can act as a support unit for moves in Southeastern Europe or launch attacks into Rumania or Sevastopol if Turkey becomes hostile.
    - Provides flexibility in either moving back towards Moscow for defense or pushing into Balkan territories held by Austria or Turkey.

Given the adjacency of my units and the potential threats from Turkey and Austria, my orders will focus on solidifying control while preparing for potential expansions. The order choices will be defensive but ready to exploit any openings provided by the movements of other powers.

## Orders

Here are the specific orders planned:

1. **Galicia (A GAL)**:
   - Move to Rumania. This move is aimed at contesting control of an important supply center and disrupting Turkish influence in the area.
   - Since Galicia borders Rumania and no significant immediate threat from adjacent Austrian territories, this move is feasible.
 
2. **Sweden (F SWE)**:
   - Hold. This maintains control of Sweden and keeps the Fleet ready to support actions in the Baltic or Norwegian Seas.
   - Holding also prevents the fleet from being stretched too thin across multiple fronts.

3. **Ukraine (A UKR)**:
   - Support move from Galicia to Rumania. This reinforces the attack on Rumania, ensuring that if Turkey tries to hold or counter-move, the support increases the chances of a successful Russian advance.
   - Ukraine is crucial for bolstering moves towards the Balkans and provides a defensive buffer for Moscow.

### JSON Representation of the Orders:

```json
{
  "phase": "S1903M",
  "reason": "Expanding control in Balkans, defending existing territories, and preparing for potential engagements with Turkey and Austria. Focusing on consolidating positions while maintaining flexibility for future offensives.",
  "my_location": ["SWE", "GAL", "UKR"],
  "my_unit": ["F SWE", "A GAL", "A UKR"],
  "adjacent": [{"GAL": ["BOH", "BUD", "RUM", "SIL", "UKR", "VIE", "WAR"]}, {"SWE": ["BAL", "BOT", "DEN", "FIN", "NWY", "SKA"]}, {"UKR": ["GAL", "MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "WAR"]}],
  "other_power_location": ["RUM", "BUD", "NWY"],
  "move_to_our_region_mask": [1, 1, 1],
  "attackable": ["RUM"],
  "attack_analysis": [{"RUM": 2}],
  "support_given": [{"supporter": "UKR", "supported": "GAL", "target": "RUM"}],
  "attack_mask": {

  },
  "orders": {
    "RUSSIA": ["F SWE H", "A GAL - RUM", "A UKR S A GAL - RUM"]
  }
}
```

With these orders, Russia aims to strengthen its position in Eastern Europe while staying prepared to respond to movements from other powers. The focus is on securing and expanding influence without overextending forces.

Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

I'll analyze the game state and develop a strategy step by step for Italy and Turkey.

Step 1: Current State Analysis
- Italy currently controls: NAP, ROM, VEN, TRI, SER (5 supply centers)
- Turkey currently controls: ANK, CON, SMY, SEV, BUL, RUM (6 supply centers)
- Italy units: F ION, A NAP, F ROM, A SER, A TRI
- Turkey units: F ANK, A SEV, F CON, A SMY, A RUM

Step 2: Strategic Objectives
- Italy's goal: Expand in the Balkan and Mediterranean regions
- Turkey's goal: Consolidate control in the Balkans and Black Sea region

Step 3: Potential Moves
Italy:
- F ION seems strategically positioned to support expansion
- A NAP could potentially move to Greece or Albania via convoy
- A SER can support movements in the Balkan region

Turkey:
- A RUM can support moves towards Bulgaria or Ukraine
- F CON can support naval movements
- A SMY has potential for expansion

Step 4: Detailed Strategic Reasoning
- Italy will attempt to convoy A NAP to Greece to gain a new supply center
- Turkey will focus on consolidating control in the Black Sea and Balkan regions
- Mutual support will be crucial for both powers

Step 5: Proposed Orders

Here's the JSON representation of the strategy:

```json
{
    "phase": "S1903M",
    "reason": "Coordinated expansion in Mediterranean and Balkan regions, focusing on gaining new supply centers through strategic convoys and supports",

        {"supporter": "F CON", "supported": "A RUM", "target": "BUD"}
    ],
    "attack_mask": {
        "ITALY": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "TURKEY": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
    },
    "orders": {
        "ITALY": [
            "F ION C A NAP - GRE",
            "A NAP - GRE VIA",
            "F ROM H",
            "A SER S A NAP - GRE",
            "A TRI H"
        ],
        "TURKEY": [
            "F ANK H",
            "A SEV H",
            "F CON S A RUM - BUD",
            "A SMY H",
            "A RUM - BUD"
        ]
    }
}
```

Key Strategic Moves:
1. Italy attempts to convoy A NAP to Greece with support from F ION and A SER
2. Turkey supports A RUM's move to Budapest
3. Defensive holds in other locations to maintain current positions

The strategy aims to:
- Expand Italy's influence by gaining Greece
- Support Turkey's potential move into Budapest
- Maintain defensive positions in other regions

This approach balances expansion with defensive considerations, leveraging the strengths of both powers.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],

    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

Let's break down the game situation and make strategic decisions for the current phase:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 0. Recap of Negotiation Phase
- It's important to remember any alliances, promises, or threats made. Unfortunately, we don't have specific negotiation details now, but the strategic positioning of units might indicate past alliances or conflicts.

#### 1. Current State Analysis
**Austria:**
- Units: A BUD, F AEG, A GRE
- Supply Centers: BUD, VIE, GRE
- Influenced Regions: BUD, VIE, AEG, GRE, ALB

**England:**
- Units: F MAO, F IRI, F STP/NC, A YOR
- Supply Centers: EDI, LON, LVP, STP
- Influenced Regions: EDI, LVP, ENG, LON, MAO, IRI, STP, YOR

**Other Powers' Influences:**
- Germany is strong in the North and Central Europe.
- France and Italy are our immediate neighbors in the West and South, respectively.
- Russia is present in the North with forces in SWE, possibly threatening STP/NC.

#### 2. Goal and Strategic Plan
The goal is to control more supply centers. Austria should focus on the Balkans and maintaining a strong position in the Mediterranean while England should maintain control in Northern Europe and possibly expand into France or contend with Germany.

#### 3. Possible Orders Analysis
**Austria Orders:**
- F AEG: **Focus on controlling the Aegean and supporting land operations.**
  - Move to the Eastern Mediterranean (EAS) or support GRE if possible.
- A BUD: **Maintain strong control in the Balkans.**
  - Support GRE or advance towards RUM.
- A GRE: **Positional advantage in Southern Balkans.**
  - Consider moving to ALB for potential future positioning.

**England Orders:**
- F MAO: **Naval dominance in the Mid-Atlantic.**
  - Move to ENG to control the English Channel or support operations against France.
- F IRI: **Control of Irish Sea, consider advancing.**
  - Move to ENG or support MAO.
- F STP/NC: **Defend or advance in Northern Europe.**
  - Hold or support NWY attack or defense if necessary.
- A YOR: **Versatile positioning in England.**
  - Consider moving to LON for defense or WAL for offense.

#### 4. Make Order Decisions

#### 5. Verification and Revision
- Ensure moves are feasible and strategically advantageous.
- Verify support is given for potential attacks and defense.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

   - **F WES (Western Mediterranean):**
     - Can support A POR - SPA or move to MAO to confront England's fleet.
     - Possible Orders: Support A POR - SPA, move to MAO, hold.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - **A PAR - BUR:** Attack German army in BUR, securing our border.
   - **A BRE S A PAR - BUR:** Support the attack on BUR to increase chances of success.
   - **A POR - SPA:** Capture the unoccupied SPA to gain a supply center.
   - **F WES S A POR - SPA:** Support A POR's move to SPA to ensure success.

5. **Verification:**
   - **Attack Targets:** BUR is not our controlled region; attacking is appropriate.
   - **Support:** We have enough units to support our attacks on BUR and SPA.
   - **Rules Compliance:** All moves are to adjacent regions, and supports are valid.

This is the retreat phase. You must retreat your units that have been dislodged. If you do not retreat a unit, it will be disbanded.

Please respond with a JSON object like:
{
"reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
"orders": {
    "FRANCE": ["A MAR R SPA", ...],
    ...
}
}

Where "orders" is a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of each location's decision. For each location, you can only issue one order. The length of the list of each power should match the number of locations for which you can issue orders.

The string should be able to be parsed to json str. So don't use special characters like \n, \t, etc. Generate the text with standard straight double quotes. Do not add comments inside the output!
The possible orders you can issue are as follows:
{'FRANCE': {}}

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'HEL': ['DEN', 'HOL', 'KIE', 'NTH']}, {'MAR': ['BUR', 'gas', 'LYO', 'PIE', 'SPA/SC', 'SWI']}, {'NTH': ['BEL', 'DEN', 'EDI', 'ENG', 'LON', 'HEL', 'HOL', 'NWY', 'NWG', 'SKA', 'YOR']}, {'PIC': ['BEL', 'BRE', 'BUR', 'ENG', 'PAR']}, {'RUH': ['BEL', 'BUR', 'HOL', 'KIE', 'MUN']}, {'SKA': ['DEN', 'NWY', 'NTH', 'SWE']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>

Given the current state of the game and my position as Russia, I will outline my strategic analysis, reasoning, and orders for the Fall 1903 Movement phase.

### Strategic Reasoning:

- **Current Position and Analysis:**
  - I control Moscow, Warsaw, Sweden, Rumania but have units positioned in Ukraine, Sweden, and Rumania.
  - The adjacent territories from Ukraine are Moscow, Rumania, Sevastopol, Galicia, and Warsaw. From Sweden, it's Baltic Sea, Bothnia, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Skagerrak. From Rumania, options include Bulgaria, Budapest, Serbia, Sevastopol, Ukraine, and Galicia.
  - My key objective is to secure as many supply centers as possible, primarily targeting vulnerable and adjacent supply centers.

- **Opportunity and Threat Analysis:**
  - Turkey is a direct competitor for control in the Balkans and Black Sea region. Control of Sevastopol, currently a Turkish-held territory, is pivotal.
  - Germany poses a threat from the north-west; however, they are currently entangled with England and France, potentially allowing me to focus on consolidating power in the south and east.

- **Expansion Plans:**
  - Prioritize taking Sevastopol back from Turkey to secure my southern flank and increase my supply center count.
  - Consolidate control in the Balkans by supporting movements into Bulgaria if feasible or defending Rumania aggressively.
  - Maintain stability in the northern territories using Sweden's fleet.

### Orders:

1. **For the Army in Ukraine (A UKR):**
   - **Order:** Move to Sevastopol (A UKR - SEV)
   - **Reasoning:** Sevastopol is currently controlled by Turkey. Recapturing this supply center is critical to securing the southern frontier and countering Turkish influence.

2. **For the Fleet in Sweden (F SWE):**
   - **Order:** Hold (F SWE H)
   - **Reasoning:** Sweden's strategic position in the north needs to be maintained defensively this turn to ascertain moves by German and English fleets. Holding ensures no surprise takeovers.

3. **For the Army in Rumania (A RUM):**
   - **Order:** Support Army Ukraine to Sevastopol (A RUM S A UKR - SEV)
   - **Reasoning:** Support from Rumania will increase the likelihood of successfully moving into Sevastopol, overcoming potential defenses by Turkey.

     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Key strategic points:
1. Italy attempts to take Bulgaria with multiple supports
2. Turkey supports Italy's Bulgarian move and starts expanding towards Ukraine and Armenia
3. Maintaining defensive positions in other territories
4. Creating opportunities for future expansion

The strategy aims to destabilize Austrian and Russian positions while creating collaborative opportunities between Italy and Turkey.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}

     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

Let's analyze the situation step by step and develop a strategic plan for issuing orders in this phase of the game.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### 0. Recap Negotiation Phase

In the negotiation phase, there might have been promises or threats that could influence current actions. Given no notes are provided, we will assume we need to focus on strategically important moves rather than relying on alliances or conflicts known from the negotiation phase.

### 1. Analyze the Current State

#### Austria
- **Units**: A BUD, F EAS, A ALB
- **Supply Centers**: BUD, VIE, GRE
- **Influence**: BUD, VIE, AEG, EAS, ALB

#### England
- **Units**: F IRI, F STP/NC, F ENG, A WAL
- **Supply Centers**: EDI, LON, LVP, STP
- **Influence**: EDI, LVP, LON, MAO, IRI, STP, YOR, ENG, WAL

#### Other Powers
- Notably, Germany has strong positioning with units in NTH, RUH, PIC, SKA, MAR, and HEL, indicating a strong central position in Europe.
- Turkey controls SEV and has influence in surrounding areas.

### 2. Supply Center Strategy

Given our current control:
- **Austria**: Focus on securing Serbia and protecting against potential advances from Turkey or Russia.
- **England**: Consolidate position in the North Sea and support moves in strategic locations like Belgium or Holland.

### 3. Analyze Possible Orders for Units

For each unit, consider moves that could gain control of supply centers or improve strategic positioning.

#### Austria

- **A ALB**: Potential to attack into Greece or provide support.
- **A BUD**: Possible to move to RUM or support moves to prevent advancement by Turkey or Russia.
- **F EAS**: Can support naval operations around ION and AEG.

#### England

- **F ENG**: Can move to MAO, support land advances, or protect sea routes.
- **F IRI**: Support for naval dominance in MAO or support WAL.
- **F STP/NC**: Protect against or push into Norwegian holdings.
- **A WAL**: Potential to move to LON or reinforce English land positions.

### 4. Order Decision

Prioritize gaining and securing supply centers, preparing for future offensive, and ensuring the defense of currently held territories.

### 5. Verification of Orders

Check if orders align with strategic objectives and game rules.

### Final Decision

Here's the final decision in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "phase": "F1903M",
    "reason": "Austria should consolidate support in the Balkans to secure GRE and BUD. England should focus on maintaining dominance in northern territories and prepare for potential moves into Belgium or Holland.",

    ],
    "other_power_location": ["UKR", "SWE", "RUM", "ANK", "CON", "SMY", "BUL"],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    "attackable": ["GRE", "RUM", "NAO", "BEL", "HOL"],
    "attack_analysis": [{"GRE": 1}, {"RUM": 1}, {"NAO": 1}, {"BEL": 2}, {"HOL": 2}],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUD", "supported": "ALB", "target": "GRE"}],
    "attack_mask": {
        "AUSTRIA": [1, 1, 0, 0],
        "ENGLAND": [0, 0, 1, 1]
    },
    "orders": {
        "AUSTRIA": ["A ALB - GRE", "A BUD S A ALB - GRE", "F EAS - ION"],
        "ENGLAND": ["F ENG - BEL", "F IRI S F ENG - BEL", "A WAL S F ENG - BEL", "F STP/NC H"]
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Orders

- **Austria**:
  - **A ALB - GRE**: Attempt to take Greece.
  - **A BUD S A ALB - GRE**: Support for Albania's move to Greece.
  - **F EAS - ION**: Control over the Ionian Sea to support further moves or defense.

- **England**:
  - **F ENG - BEL**: Move to Belgium to potentially gain control.
  - **F IRI S F ENG - BEL**: Support for move into Belgium.
  - **A WAL S F ENG - BEL**: Additional support for move into Belgium.
  - **F STP/NC H**: Hold position to maintain northern presence.

This plan focuses on consolidating positions and expanding into vulnerable areas. Adjust as necessary based on other players' movements and strategies.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

### 0. Recap of Previous Negotiations

(Note: No notes are provided for this state.)

Since no specific negotiations are provided, we'll proceed based on the current game state and anticipate potential moves from other powers.

### 1. Analyzing the Current State

- **Our Supply Centers**: BRE, MAR, PAR, POR (Note: MAR is currently occupied by Germany's unit)
- **Our Units**:
  - **A BRE** (Army in Brest)
  - **A BUR** (Army in Burgundy)
  - **A SPA** (Army in Spain)
  - **F WES** (Fleet in Western Mediterranean)

- **Influence/Control**: PAR, BRE, WES, POR, BUR, SPA

- **Enemy Units Adjacent to Us**:
  - **Germany**:
    - **A MAR** (Army in Marseilles) - Occupying our home supply center
    - **A PIC** (Army in Picardy) - Adjacent to BRE and BUR
    - **A RUH** (Army in Ruhr) - Adjacent to BUR
  - **England**:
    - **F ENG** (Fleet in English Channel) - Adjacent to BRE
    - **A WAL** (Army in Wales) - Can move to BRE
  - **Potential Threats**:
    - England is poised to attack BRE with F ENG and A WAL.
    - Germany may attempt to advance further into our territory.

### 2. Planning to Take More Supply Centers

- **Primary Objective**: Recapture MAR (Marseilles) from Germany.
- **Secondary Objective**: Defend against England's likely attack on BRE.
- **Considerations**:
  - We likely cannot hold BRE against England's attack strength of 2.
  - Germany cannot easily support MAR, as their adjacent units cannot support it.
  - Recapturing MAR will restore our home supply center and strengthen our position.

### 3. Possible Orders and Analysis

#### **Unit: A BUR (Burgundy)**

- **Possible Orders**:
  - **A BUR - MAR**: Attack Marseilles.
  - **A BUR H**: Hold in place.
  - **A BUR S A BRE - PIC**: Support A BRE in attacking Picardy.

- **Analysis**:
  - **Attacking MAR**: Offers a chance to recapture our supply center.
  - **Risk**: If we vacate BUR, Germany might move into it from RUH.
  - **Decision**: Prioritize recapturing MAR to regain our supply center.

#### **Unit: A SPA (Spain)**

- **Possible Orders**:
  - **A SPA S A BUR - MAR**: Support A BUR attacking MAR.
  - **A SPA - MAR**: Attack MAR directly.
  - **A SPA H**: Hold position to defend SPA.

- **Analysis**:
  - **Supporting A BUR - MAR**: Increases our attack strength to 2.
  - **Direct Attack**: Without support, less likely to succeed.
  - **Decision**: Support A BUR to ensure the attack on MAR succeeds.

#### **Unit: F WES (Western Mediterranean)**

- **Possible Orders**:
  - **F WES - MAO**: Move to Mid-Atlantic Ocean.
  - **F WES - LYO**: Move to Gulf of Lyon.
  - **F WES H**: Hold position.

- **Analysis**:
  - **Moving to MAO**: Positions us to counter England's naval forces and defend our western coast.
  - **Moving to LYO**: Could assist in future southern operations but less immediate benefit.
  - **Decision**: Move to MAO to prepare for potential conflicts with England.

#### **Unit: A BRE (Brest)**

- **Possible Orders**:
  - **A BRE H**: Hold in place.
  - **A BRE - GAS**: Move to Gascogne.
  - **A BRE - PAR**: Move to Paris.
  - **A BRE - PIC**: Attack Picardy.

- **Analysis**:
  - **Holding**: Will likely be dislodged due to England's attack strength of 2.
  - **Moving to GAS**: Preserves the unit for future operations.
  - **Moving to PAR**: Doesn't offer strategic advantage.
  - **Decision**: Move to GAS to retain the unit and potentially counter-attack in future turns.

### 4. Verifying Orders Against Game Rules

- **A BUR - MAR**:
  - **Valid Move**: MAR is adjacent to BUR.
  - **Attack Target**: MAR is occupied by Germany.
  - **Support**: Supported by A SPA.
- **A SPA S A BUR - MAR**:
  - **Valid Support**: SPA is adjacent to MAR.
  - **Supporting Correct Unit**: A BUR is indeed attacking MAR.
- **F WES - MAO**:
  - **Valid Move**: MAO is adjacent to WES.
  - **Strategic Position**: Prepares defense against England.
- **A BRE - GAS**:
  - **Valid Move**: GAS is adjacent to BRE.
  - **Preserving Unit**: Avoids being dislodged and keeps unit active.

### 5. Finalizing the Plan

- **Orders**:
  - **A BUR - MAR**
  - **A SPA S A BUR - MAR**
  - **F WES - MAO**
  - **A BRE - GAS**

- **Risks**:
  - **England will capture BRE**: Cannot be prevented this turn.
  - **Germany may move into BUR**: Acceptable risk to recapture MAR.
  - **Potential Bounce in GAS**: If Germany moves A MAR - GAS, both units will bounce.

- **Strategic Focus**: Regain MAR, prepare naval defenses, preserve units for future actions.

### Verification Against Rules and Objectives

- **Objectives Met**:
  - Retaking a supply center (MAR).
  - Maintaining unit positions for future offensives.
- **Rules Compliance**:
  - All moves are to adjacent regions.
  - Support orders are valid and correctly formatted.
  - No moves target our own unit locations improperly.

    "reason": "Our main goal is to recapture Marseilles (MAR), our home supply center currently occupied by Germany, and to defend against potential attacks from Germany and England.

There are no neutral powers in this game.
This is the build/disband phase. You can build new units in your home centers, or disband units if you have too many. Remember, you need to control enough supply centers to win.

Please respond with a JSON object like:
{
"reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
"orders": {
    "FRANCE": ["F BRE B", "A PAR B", ...],
    ...
}
}

Where "orders" is a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of each location's decision. For each location, you can only issue one order. The length of the list of each power should match the number of locations for which you can issue orders.

The string should be able to be parsed to json str. So don't use special characters like \n, \t, etc. Generate the text with standard straight double quotes. Do not add comments inside the output! 
The possible orders you can issue are as follows:
{'FRANCE': {'BRE': ['A BRE B', 'F BRE B', 'WAIVE'], 'PAR': ['WAIVE', 'A PAR B']}}
Remember, you need to reach the configured number of supply centers (build more and more supply centers) to win.

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'BUR': ['BEL', 'GAS', 'RUH', 'MAR', 'MUN', 'PAR', 'PIC', 'SWI']}, {'DEN': ['BAL', 'HEL', 'KIE', 'NTH', 'SKA', 'SWE']}, {'EDI': ['CLY', 'lvp', 'NTH', 'NWG', 'YOR']}, {'MUN': ['BER', 'BOH', 'BUR', 'KIE', 'RUH', 'SIL', 'TYR', 'SWI']}, {'NTH': ['BEL', 'DEN', 'EDI', 'ENG', 'LON', 'HEL', 'HOL', 'NWY', 'NWG', 'SKA', 'YOR']}, {'PIC': ['BEL', 'BRE', 'BUR', 'ENG', 'PAR']}, {'PIE': ['LYO', 'MAR', 'TUS', 'TYR', 'ven', 'SWI']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

To create an effective strategy for this turn in Diplomacy as Russia, let's analyze the current board position, potential moves, and strategic implications. Here are the steps I will take:

1. **Analyzing Current Position:**
   - **Units**: Russia has units in RUM, SEV, SWE, and WAR.
   - **Supply Centers**: Currently held are WAR, SWE, SEV, RUM.
   - **Strategic Consideration**: Controlling southeastern Europe (Black Sea region) is crucial for Russia's expansion, particularly against Turkish territories. Sweden's defense is also key against potential threats from the north.

2. **Identify Targets and Threats:**
   - **Targets for Expansion**: Based on the map's adjacency, Turkey's territories are vulnerable. Bulgaria (BUL) and Ankara (ANK) could be potential targets.
   - **Defensive Priorities**: Maintaining control over current holdings, especially SEV and WAR, against any counterattacks.

3. **Formulating Potential Orders:**
   - From RUM, supporting actions into SEV and potentially attacking BUL seems viable.
   - SEV can support actions in RUM or take offensive moves toward ANK or BUL.
   - SWE needs to defend the Nordic area, ideally holding position or supporting nearby naval units.
   - WAR may consider supporting actions in SEV, or moving defensively toward MOS or PRU.

4. **Evaluating Support and Movement Options:**
   - **RUM**: Given its central position, it can either support SEV or move against BUL, depending on the support from other units.
   - **SEV**: Can support RUM or launch an attack towards BUL or ANK, critical points against Turkey.
   - **SWE**: Holding or supporting neighboring sea zones is crucial.
   - **WAR**: Supporting defensive lines or moving towards MOS for eastern reinforcement.

5. **Final Order Consideration**:
   - Ensure that all movements or supports are directed toward strengthening positions or expanding into strategically important supply centers.
   - Coordinate supports to ensure successful movements where conflicts might occur.
   - Defend essential territories from possible encroachments.

Given these considerations, the orders for Russia might look like this:

```json
{
    "phase": "S1904M",
    "reason": "Expanding influence in the Black Sea region targeting vulnerable Turkish territories while defending core territories from potential northern and southern threats.",
    "my_location": ["WAR", "SWE", "SEV", "RUM"],
    "my_unit": ["A WAR", "F SWE", "A SEV", "A RUM"],
    "adjacent": [

        {"SEV": ["ARM", "BLA", "MOS", "RUM", "UKR"]},
        {"SWE": ["BAL", "BOT", "DEN", "FIN", "NWY", "SKA"]},
        {"WAR": ["GAL", "LVN", "MOS", "PRU", "SIL", "UKR"]}
    ],
    "other_power_location": ["BUL", "ANK"],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 0, 1, 1],
    "attackable": ["BUL", "ANK"],
    "attack_analysis": [{"BUL": 2}, {"ANK": 2}],
    "support_given": [
        {"supporter": "A SEV", "supported": "A RUM", "target": "BUL"},
        {"supporter": "A RUM", "supported": "A SEV", "target": "BUL"}
    ],
    "attack_mask": {
        "RUSSIA": [0, 0, 1, 1]
    },
    "orders": {
        "RUSSIA": ["A WAR H", "F SWE H", "A SEV S A RUM - BUL", "A RUM - BUL"]
    }
}
```

This strategy focuses on consolidating power in the Black Sea, potentially taking Bulgaria, which is a strategic move against Turkey. The orders reflect a combined attack and support strategy in the south, with defensive holds in the north and west to secure the current holdings.

    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],

    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],

     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let's break down the decision-making process and prepare a plan for the orders given these circumstances:

### Step-by-step Analysis:

0. **Recap of Negotiation Phase**: Without specific negotiation phase details, we'll have to rely on the current board state for decision-making.

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - **Austria**:
     - Units: A BUD, F EAS, A GRE
     - Supply Centers: BUD, VIE, GRE
     - Influence: BUD, VIE, AEG, EAS, ALB, GRE
   - **England**:
     - Units: F IRI, F STP/NC, A WAL, F BEL
     - Supply Centers: LON, LVP, STP, BEL
     - Influence: LVP, LON, IRI, STP, YOR, ENG, WAL, BEL

2. **Objective Analysis**:
   - Aim for further control over supply centers, particularly those not currently under control or contestable.
   - **Austria** could eye regions like Galicia (GAL), Rumania (RUM), and Serbia (SER).
   - **England** might aim for Norway (NWY) or secure the English Channel (ENG).

3. **Unit Actions and Strategies**:
   - **Austria**:
     - **A BUD** could move towards RUM or provide support to nearby actions.
     - **F EAS** could try to control SMY or assist actions in the Ionian Sea.
     - **A GRE** could move to Albania (ALB) or Bulgaria (BUL).
   - **England**:
     - **F IRI** can support movements into LVP or ENG.
     - **F STP/NC** can move towards NWY for a strategic position.
     - **A WAL** could move to LON or provide support around YOR.
     - **F BEL** could move to secure ENG or move against NTH.

4. **Order Decision** (Considerations & Strategic Moves):
   - Ensuring Austria secures influence around the Balkans and Eastern Mediterranean.
   - Ensuring England maintains a foothold in Northern Europe and secures the Channel.

5. **Verification of Moves**: Based on rules and adjacency, make sure planned moves, supports, and convoys are valid.

Now, let’s finalize the plan with these strategies in mind:

```json

    ],
    "support_given": [
        {"supporter": "BUD", "supported": "GRE", "target": "SER"},
        {"supporter": "IRI", "supported": "WAL", "target": "LVP"}
    ],
    "attack_mask": {
        "AUSTRIA": [1, 1, 1],
        "ENGLAND": [1, 1, 0, 1]
    },
    "orders": {
        "AUSTRIA": [
            "A BUD - RUM",
            "F EAS - SMY",

        ],
        "ENGLAND": [
            "F BEL - ENG",
            "F IRI S A WAL - LVP",
            "A WAL - LVP",
            "F STP/NC - NWY"
        ]
    }
}
```

This plan focuses on aggression and positioning to increase control over supply centers while making strategic supports to maximize influence and secure critical areas.

[{'GAS': ['BUR', 'BRE', 'MAO', 'mar', 'PAR', 'SPA/NC']}, {'MAO': ['BRE', 'ENG', 'GAS', 'IRI', 'NAF', 'NAO', 'POR', 'SPA/NC', 'SPA/SC', 'WES']}, {'MAR': ['BUR', 'gas', 'LYO', 'PIE', 'SPA/SC', 'SWI']}, {'PAR': ['BUR', 'BRE', 'GAS', 'PIC']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

0. **Previous Negotiation Phase:**
   - No prior negotiation information is provided.

1. **Current State Analysis:**
   - **Our Units:**
     - Armies in SPA, GAS, MAR, PAR.
     - Fleet in MAO.
   - **Our Supply Centers:**
     - BRE, MAR, PAR, POR, SPA.
   - **Our Influenced Regions:**
     - PAR, BRE, WES, POR, SPA, GAS, MAO, MAR.
   - **Enemy Units Adjacent to Us:**
     - German armies in BUR, PIC, PIE.
     - English army in WAL.
   - Germany poses a significant threat with armies surrounding our territories.
   - England has units that could potentially attack our western regions.

2. **Strategic Goals:**
   - Defend key regions (PAR, BRE) from German and English advances.
   - Attempt to dislodge German armies in PIE and reduce their influence.
   - Protect our supply centers to maintain our unit count.

3. **Unit Order Analysis:**
   - **A PAR (Paris):**
     - Will hold to defend against potential attacks.
   - **A GAS (Gascony):**
     - Will support A PAR to hold, strengthening defense.
   - **A MAR (Marseilles):**
     - Will attack PIE to dislodge the German army.
     - Adjacent to PIE and can be supported.
   - **A SPA (Spain):**
     - Will support A MAR's attack on PIE.
   - **F MAO (Mid-Atlantic Ocean):**
     - Will move to BRE to defend against a possible English attack from WAL.
     - Adjacent to BRE and prevents England from easily capturing it.

4. **Decision Verification:**
   - All moves are to adjacent regions.
   - Supports are valid as supporting units are adjacent to the units they are supporting.
   - Attacks are directed at enemy-held regions (PIE).
   - Defense is prioritized for PAR and BRE, which are critical supply centers.

5. **Order Validation:**
   - Orders conform to the game's rules and aim to achieve our strategic goals.
   - No orders involve moving into our own controlled regions unnecessarily.
   - Supports are correctly assigned to units that are performing corresponding actions.

6. **Finalize Orders:**
   - Confident that orders are valid and strategically sound.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Given the current setup and strategic needs, and considering the adjacent regions and the potential for expansion, here is the formulated plan for Russia in the Fall of 1904:

### Strategic Reasoning:
1. **Objective:** Expand control to more supply centers, leverage current unit positions for securing surrounding territories, and disrupt enemy formations where possible.
2. **Immediate Actions:** 
   - Utilize the army in Rumania (RUM) to exert pressure in the Balkans and potentially on Turkey.
   - Strengthen the defense of Sevastopol (SEV) while positioning for a possible offensive towards Ukraine (UKR) or the Black Sea (BLA).
   - Secure the Scandinavian region further by moving the fleet in Sweden (SWE) to Norway (NWY), extending influence.
   - Use the army in Warsaw (WAR) to support movements in the eastern front, particularly towards either Galicia (GAL) or Ukraine (UKR).

### Detailed Order Plan:
1. **Rumania (RUM):** Attempt to attack Bulgaria in coordination with support from the Black Sea, aiming to cut Turkish influence and secure a strategic position in the Balkans.
2. **Sevastopol (SEV):** Hold position but support any offensive from Rumania towards Ukraine or counter any assaults.
3. **Sweden (SWE):** Move the fleet towards Norway to secure the Scandinavian region further and cut off German access.
4. **Warsaw (WAR):** Support any movements towards Galicia to secure the eastern front and disrupt Austrian stability.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

I'll analyze the game state and develop a strategic approach step by step for Italy and Turkey:

## Step 1: Current State Analysis

### Italy's Position:
- Current Supply Centers: NAP, ROM, VEN, TRI, SER, BUL (6 centers)
- Units:
  - F AEG (Aegean Sea)
  - F NAP (Naples)
  - F ROM (Rome)
  - A SER (Serbia)
  - A BUL (Bulgaria)
  - A VEN (Venice)

### Turkey's Position:
- Current Supply Centers: ANK, CON, SMY, MOS (4 centers)
- Units:
  - A ARM (Armenia)
  - F BLA (Black Sea)
  - F CON (Constantinople)
  - A UKR (Ukraine)

## Step 2: Strategic Goals
1. Expand control of supply centers
2. Weaken neighboring powers
3. Create strategic positioning for future turns

## Step 3: Detailed Unit Analysis and Potential Moves

### Italy's Strategic Considerations:
1. F AEG has multiple strategic options:
   - Support movement into Greece
   - Potentially convoy Bulgarian army
   - Block other powers' sea movements

2. A BUL can potentially move to:
   - Greece
   - Constantinople
   - Support other movements

3. A VEN could:
   - Move to Trieste
   - Move to Tyrolia
   - Support other movements

### Turkey's Strategic Considerations:
1. A ARM can:
   - Move to Syria
   - Move to Sevastopol
   - Support Black Sea movements

2. F BLA has convoy and support capabilities

3. A UKR can:
   - Move to Galicia
   - Move to Rumania
   - Support other movements

## Step 4: Potential Attack Strategies

### Italy's Potential Attacks:
- A BUL could attack Greece
- A VEN could potentially move towards Trieste
- F AEG could support movements in Aegean region

### Turkey's Potential Attacks:
- A ARM could move towards Sevastopol
- A UKR could support movements in Rumania/Ukraine region

## Step 5: Finalized Strategy

After careful analysis, here's a strategic JSON representation:

Strategic Reasoning:
1. Italy focuses on securing Greece through coordinated movement and support
2. Turkey attempts to expand into Rumania and potentially Sevastopol
3. Defensive postures maintained in other regions
4. Collaborative strategy between Italy and Turkey to expand Balkan influence

The strategy aims to:
- Expand territorial control
- Minimize risk
- Create pressure on neighboring powers
- Maintain flexibility for future moves

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the strategy or analysis?

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'ALB': ['ADR', 'GRE', 'ION', 'SER', 'TRI']}, {'BUD': ['GAL', 'RUM', 'SER', 'TRI', 'VIE']}, {'SMY': ['AEG', 'ank', 'arm', 'CON', 'EAS', 'SYR']}, {'ENG': ['BEL', 'BRE', 'IRI', 'LON', 'MAO', 'NTH', 'PIC', 'WAL']}, {'IRI': ['ENG', 'LVP', 'MAO', 'NAO', 'WAL']}, {'LVP': ['CLY', 'edi', 'IRI', 'NAO', 'WAL', 'yor']}, {'NWY': ['BAR', 'fin', 'NTH', 'NWG', 'SKA', 'STP/NC', 'SWE']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let's go through the steps to analyze the current situation and draft a strategy for AUSTRIA and ENGLAND.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 0: Recap of Negotiation Phase
There is no information provided about previous negotiations, so I must base my strategy purely on the current board state.

### Step 1: Current State Analysis
#### AUSTRIA
- **Supply Centers**: BUD, VIE, GRE
- **Units**: A BUD, F SMY, A ALB
- **Strategic Considerations**:
  - SMY is far from home centers and currently isolated.
  - ALB is in a position to affect TRI, GRE, and SER.
  - BUD can support moves into RUM or defend against Turkey’s potential attack from UKR/SEV.

#### ENGLAND
- **Supply Centers**: LON, LVP, STP, BEL
- **Units**: F IRI, F NWY, A LVP, F ENG
- **Strategic Considerations**:
  - NWY can be used to pressure SWE or SKA.
  - ENG is in a strategic sea zone controlling access to the English Channel and could support movements on the Continent.
  - LVP has options to convoy or support other units due to its central location.

### Step 2: Goal to Control More Supply Centers
- Austria should aim to reinforce its position in the Balkans and consider recapturing home centers like TRI.
- England should aim to defend its scattered northern positions while considering expanding into Scandinavian territories like SWE.

### Step 3: Consider Possible Orders
#### AUSTRIA
- **ALB**: Can support moves into adjacent contested regions such as SER.
- **BUD**: Should focus on supporting RUM to maintain balance against Russia.
- **SMY**: Isolated, but it could retreat to EAS for a potential convoy or attack positions like CON.

#### ENGLAND
- **IRI**: Can support or convoy LVP to further northern territories.
- **NWY**: Should consider taking STP/NC or defending against potential movements into the North Sea.
- **LVP**: Can position itself to support ENG or consider convoy into nearby supply centers.
- **ENG**: Key position for supporting or convoying units to the mainland.

### Step 4 & 5: Make and Verify Orders

Let's finalize our orders for Austria and England.

    }
}
```

### Strategic Reasoning
- **Austria's Strategy:** Austria focuses on consolidating control in the Balkans by moving ALB to SER with support from BUD. SMY moves to EAS to potentially be useful in broader Mediterranean operations or future movements.
  
- **England's Strategy:** NWY is moved against STP/NC to pressure Russia and potentially gain a new center. LVP is convoyed to BRE, leveraging ENG's position in the channel to support the convoy, thus aiming to expand into French territories.

This plan aims to strengthen positions and prepare for further expansions in strategic locations.

There are no neutral powers in this game.

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'BRE': ['ENG', 'GAS', 'MAO', 'PAR', 'PIC']}, {'GAS': ['BUR', 'BRE', 'MAO', 'mar', 'PAR', 'SPA/NC']}, {'PAR': ['BUR', 'BRE', 'GAS', 'PIC']}, {'PIE': ['LYO', 'MAR', 'TUS', 'TYR', 'ven', 'SWI']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Where "orders" is a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of each location's decision. For each location, you can only issue one order. The length of the list of each power should match the number of locations for which you can issue orders.

The string should be able to be parsed to json str. So don't use special characters like \n, \t, etc. Generate the text with standard straight double quotes. Do not add comments inside the output!
The possible orders you can issue are as follows:
{'RUSSIA': {}}

total tokens used in this call:  5419
input tokens used in this call:  5323
output tokens used in this call:  96
Since no Russian units need to retreat and no orders are necessary for Russia in this retreat phase, the appropriate JSON object response would be:

```json
{
    "reason": "No Russian units have been dislodged and therefore no retreat orders are necessary for Russia in this phase.",
    "orders": {
        "RUSSIA": []
    }
}
```

This response indicates that Russia doesn't have to issue any retreat orders as no units were dislodged.

Where "orders" is a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of each location's decision. For each location, you can only issue one order. The length of the list of each power should match the number of locations for which you can issue orders.

The string should be able to be parsed to json str. So don't use special characters like \n, \t, etc. Generate the text with standard straight double quotes. Do not add comments inside the output! 
The possible orders you can issue are as follows:

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

To strategize effectively as Russia in this phase of the game, I need to consider both my current position and the moves of my opponents. Here's the breakdown of my analysis and subsequent orders:

### Strategic Analysis

1. **Current Holdings and Unit Positions**
   - I control `WAR`, `SWE`, `SEV`, and `BUL`.
   - My units: F in `SWE`, A in `SEV`, A in `WAR`, A in `BUL`.

2. **Goals and Possible Expansions**
   - **SEV**: Positioned to potentially expand into `RUM` and `ARM`. `RUM` is a strategic point currently under Turkish control but adjacent and reachable.
   - **WAR**: `MOS` is an important center to regain (historically a home center), further reinforcing my position in the north and increasing supply.
   - **SWE**: Could potentially assist in controlling more of the Baltic region.
   - **BUL**: Positioned crucially near several important points like `GRE`, `SER`, and `CON`.

3. **Immediate Concerns**
   - `TURKEY` is a significant threat in the south; managing this front is crucial.
   - `GERMANY` possesses a robust presence in the north and central Europe; however, the immediate threat is lower.

### Decision Making and Orders

Given the strategic analysis, the following orders are formulated for this phase:

1. **SEVASTOPOL**:
   - **Order**: A `SEV` - `RUM` (Move to Rumania)
   - **Reason**: To regain a crucial supply center and weaken Turkish control in the area.

2. **WARSAW**:
   - **Order**: A `WAR` - `MOS` (Move to Moscow)
   - **Reason**: To recapture a home supply center, strengthening my position in the north.

3. **SWEDEN**:
   - **Order**: F `SWE` - `BAL` (Move to Baltic Sea)
   - **Reason**: To position myself strategically for potential future maneuvers and provide support possibilities for movements into `DEN` or to counter German naval movements.

4. **BULGARIA**:
   - **Order**: A `BUL` S A `SEV` - `RUM` (Support Sevastopol's move to Rumania)
   - **Reason**: To ensure the success of the move into `RUM` by increasing its strength against Turkish defense.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

Let's proceed step-by-step according to the instructions:

## Step 0: Recap Negotiation Phase
For this exercise, I haven’t been informed of the negotiation phase details, so I'll focus purely on the current board state and strategic considerations.

## Step 1: Analyze Current State
- **Austria's Units and Supply Centers:**
  - Units: A BUD, F EAS, A SER
  - Supply Centers: BUD, VIE, SER
  - Aim: Maintain control of current supply centers and seek to expand into adjacent territories.

- **England's Units and Supply Centers:**
  - Units: F IRI, A LVP, F ENG
  - Supply Centers: LON, LVP, STP
  - Aim: Maintain control of current supply centers, aiming to push into adjacent territories controlled by other powers, such as France and Germany.
  
- **Supply centers total:**
  - AUSTRIA: 3
  - ENGLAND: 3

## Step 2: Determine Target Locations for Expansion
- **Austria:**
  - Possible attack or strategic movement toward: RUM (currently controlled by Turkey), TRI (controlled by Italy).
  
- **England:**
  - Potentially target: BRE (controlled by France), BEL (controlled by Germany), or make strategic positions in MAO or the North Sea.

## Step 3: Analyze Possible Orders

For each unit, I’ll consider the possible orders, focusing on expanding influence, gaining new supply centers, and strategic positioning.

### Austria's Units:
#### A BUD:
  - Consider moving to RUM to expand into Turkey's territory.
  - Possible support action could be for A SER if needed.

#### F EAS:
  - Moving to AEG or ION might be strategic to control sea routes. Alternatively, consider moving to SMY to threaten Turkey's supply center.

#### A SER:
  - Potentially move to RUM or support an attack on RUM to challenge Turkey's position.

### England's Units:
#### F ENG:
  - Consider moving to BRE to challenge France or support actions in the Channel.

#### F IRI:
  - Moving to MAO or supporting ENG could provide strategic advantage. Moving towards LVP if additional support is needed.

#### A LVP:
  - Move to WAL or support actions from IRI or ENG.

## Step 4: Make Order Decisions
Based on the analysis above, I will decide on orders ensuring we aim to expand and disrupt other players' control.

## Step 5: Self-Verification and Revision
Verifying based on the defined strategic objectives and making sure the targets are aligned with our expansion goals.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**

     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

**Step 0: Recap of Negotiation Phase**

No notes are provided for this state, so we have no specific information about any agreements, promises, or threats made by other powers during the negotiation phase. Therefore, we will base our strategy solely on the current board state.

---

**Step 1: Analyze the Current State**

- **Our Units:**

  - **Army in Gascony (A GAS)**
  - **Army in Paris (A PAR)**
  - **Fleet in Brest (F BRE)**
  - **Army in Piedmont (A PIE)**
  - **Army in Marseilles (A MAR)**

- **Our Supply Centers:**

  - **BRE (Brest)**
  - **MAR (Marseilles)**
  - **PAR (Paris)**
  - **POR (Portugal)** – Not occupied by a unit
  - **SPA (Spain)** – Not occupied by a unit

- **Our Influenced Regions:**

  - **PAR, WES, POR, SPA, GAS, MAO, BRE, PIE, MAR**

- **Other Powers' Units Near Us:**

  - **Germany:**

    - **Army in Belgium (A BEL)**
    - **Army in Ruhr (A RUH)**
    - **Army in Munich (A MUN)**
    - **Army in Tuscany (A TUS)**

  - **England:**

    - **Fleet in English Channel (F ENG)**
    - **Fleet in Irish Sea (F IRI)**
    - **Army in Liverpool (A LVP)**

  - **Italy:**

    - **Army in Venice (A VEN)**
    - **Fleet in Rome (F ROM)**
    - **Fleet in Naples (F NAP)**

- **Adjacent Regions of Our Units:**

  - **A GAS:** BUR, BRE, MAO, MAR, PAR, SPA/NC
  - **A PAR:** BUR, BRE, GAS, PIC
  - **F BRE:** ENG, GAS, MAO, PAR, PIC
  - **A MAR:** BUR, GAS, LYO, PIE, SPA/SC, SWI
  - **A PIE:** LYO, MAR, TUS, TYR, VEN, SWI

---

**Step 2: Plan to Take More Supply Centers**

- **Our Objectives:**

  - Secure our unoccupied supply centers in **Spain (SPA)** and **Portugal (POR)**.
  - Position ourselves to threaten German holdings in **Munich (MUN)** and **Belgium (BEL)**.
  - Prepare defenses against potential English advances from the **English Channel (ENG)** and **Irish Sea (IRI)**.
  - Monitor German army in **Tuscany (A TUS)** and ensure our southern borders are secure.

---

**Step 3: Analyze Possible Orders for Each Unit**

- **A GAS (Army in Gascony):**

  - **Options:**

    - Move to **Burgundy (BUR)**
    - Move to **Spain (SPA)**
    - Support other units
    - Hold

  - **Analysis:**

    - Moving to **BUR** positions us adjacent to **Munich (MUN)** and **Ruhr (RUH)** for future attacks on German supply centers.
    - Moving to **SPA** is redundant since **A MAR** can occupy it.

- **A PAR (Army in Paris):**

  - **Options:**

    - Support **A GAS** moving to **BUR**
    - Move to **Picardy (PIC)**
    - Hold

  - **Analysis:**

    - Supporting **A GAS** ensures our move to **BUR** is successful.
    - Moving to **PIC** could expose us to English forces without support.

- **F BRE (Fleet in Brest):**

  - **Options:**

    - Move to **Mid-Atlantic Ocean (MAO)**
    - Move to **English Channel (ENG)**
    - Support other units
    - Hold

  - **Analysis:**

    - Moving to **MAO** increases our naval presence and flexibility to support **POR** or counter English fleets.
    - Moving to **ENG** could provoke England; without support, it may be risky.

- **A MAR (Army in Marseilles):**

  - **Options:**

    - Move to **Spain (SPA)**
    - Move to **Burgundy (BUR)**
    - Hold

  - **Analysis:**

    - Moving to **SPA** secures our unoccupied supply center.
    - Moving to **BUR** conflicts with **A GAS** moving there.

- **A PIE (Army in Piedmont):**

  - **Options:**

    - Move to **Tyrolia (TYR)**
    - Support other units
    - Hold

  - **Analysis:**

    - Moving to **TYR** positions us to threaten **Munich (MUN)** from the south.
    - Holding may be safer but less aggressive.

---

**Step 4: Make Order Decisions**

1. **A GAS moves to BUR**, supported by **A PAR**:

   - Ensures occupation of **Burgundy** to threaten **Munich** and **Ruhr**.
   - **A PAR** provides support to guarantee the move.

2. **A MAR moves to SPA**:

   - Secures the unoccupied supply center in **Spain**.

3. **F BRE moves to MAO**:

   - Increases naval flexibility.
   - Prepares to support **Portugal** or counter English naval movements.

4. **A PIE moves to TYR**:

   - Positions us adjacent to **Munich (MUN)** and **Vienna (VIE)**.
   - Applies pressure on Germany and Austria.

---

**Step 5: Verify Orders**

- All moves are to adjacent regions.
- Support orders are valid and follow the rules.
- No orders conflict with each other.
- We are not attacking our own controlled regions.
- Attacks are not directed at regions where we lack sufficient support.

**Explanation of Orders:**

- **"A GAS - BUR"**: Moves Army in Gascony to Burgundy to position against Germany.
- **"A PAR S A GAS - BUR"**: Army in Paris supports Army Gascony's move to ensure success.
- **"A MAR - SPA"**: Moves Army in Marseilles to Spain to secure our supply center.
- **"F BRE - MAO"**: Fleet in Brest moves to Mid-Atlantic Ocean for naval flexibility.
- **"A PIE - TYR"**: Army in Piedmont moves to Tyrolia to threaten Germany from the south.

This is the retreat phase. You must retreat your units that have been dislodged. If you do not retreat a unit, it will be disbanded.

Please respond with a JSON object like:
{
"reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
"orders": {
    "FRANCE": ["A MAR R SPA", ...],
    ...
}
}

Where "orders" is a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of each location's decision. For each location, you can only issue one order. The length of the list of each power should match the number of locations for which you can issue orders.

The string should be able to be parsed to json str. So don't use special characters like \n, \t, etc. Generate the text with standard straight double quotes. Do not add comments inside the output!
The possible orders you can issue are as follows:
{'FRANCE': {}}

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'BEL': ['BUR', 'ENG', 'HOL', 'NTH', 'PIC', 'RUH']}, {'HEL': ['DEN', 'HOL', 'KIE', 'NTH']}, {'KIE': ['BAL', 'BER', 'DEN', 'HEL', 'HOL', 'MUN', 'RUH']}, {'MUN': ['BER', 'BOH', 'BUR', 'KIE', 'RUH', 'SIL', 'TYR', 'SWI']}, {'NAO': ['CLY', 'IRI', 'LVP', 'MAO', 'NWG']}, {'RUH': ['BEL', 'BUR', 'HOL', 'KIE', 'MUN']}, {'TUS': ['LYO', 'PIE', 'ROM', 'TYS', 'ven']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let's develop a strategic plan based on the current game state and the potential options available to Russia.

### Strategic Reasoning:

1. **Consolidation and Protection**: It's crucial to consolidate the strengths I currently possess while strategically expanding. I control critical supply centers in SWE, BUL, RUM, and MOS and must ensure these remain under my influence.
2. **Expansion**: I need to focus on expanding further to both safeguard my position and progressively aim towards the victory condition. 
3. **Threat Analysis**: Notably under direct threat are BUL and RUM due to proximity to other powers like Turkey. They need essential defense and possibly reinforcements.
4. **Opportunity for Growth**: Considering the adjacency and the current weak points of enemies, the Balkans and Scandinavia provide substantial opportunities for expansion. STP/NC, controlled by Germany, is another strategic point worth contesting.

### Move Analysis:

**Unit in SWE**: It has potential moves towards DEN or NWY, which can help in weakening Germany's control in Scandinavia. However, the focus should be on supporting adjacent units or holding the position to prevent any advances from the West.

**Unit in BUL**: This is a critical area close to many conflicts. Options include supporting defensive actions in RUM or taking a more aggressive stance by moving towards SER or GRE, although these require careful consideration of nearby enemy units and support.

**Unit in RUM**: Given its position, it can act defensively by supporting BUL or offensively by moving into SER or BUD. Due to proximity, it's also pivotal in defending against potential advances from Turkey.

**Unit in MOS**: This unit can provide support to SWE or RUM (particularly against SEV) or push towards UKR which could pave the way for southern advances or defensive stances against European powers.

### Proposed Orders:

**Unit SWE**:
- Fleet SWE moves to DEN to contest German control and expand Russian influence into Scandinavia.

**Unit BUL**:
- Army BUL holds, ready to support RUM or counter any advances from Turkey into the Balkan region.

**Unit RUM**:
- Army RUM supports Army BUL, providing a defensive reinforcement against potential threats from the Turkish units in ANK or ARM. 

**Unit MOS**:
- Army MOS moves to UKR as a strategic maneuver to strengthen the southern defensive line and possibly push further in future turns.

[{'GRE': ['AEG', 'ALB', 'BUL/SC', 'ION', 'SER']}, {'ION': ['ADR', 'AEG', 'ALB', 'APU', 'EAS', 'GRE', 'NAP', 'TUN', 'TYS']}, {'TRI': ['ADR', 'ALB', 'BUD', 'SER', 'TYR', 'VEN', 'VIE']}, {'TYS': ['ION', 'LYO', 'ROM', 'NAP', 'TUN', 'TUS', 'WES']}, {'VEN': ['ADR', 'APU', 'pie', 'rom', 'TRI', 'tus', 'TYR']}, {'ANK': ['ARM', 'BLA', 'CON', 'smy']}, {'ARM': ['ANK', 'BLA', 'SEV', 'smy', 'syr']}, {'BLA': ['ANK', 'ARM', 'BUL/EC', 'CON', 'RUM', 'SEV']}, {'CON': ['AEG', 'BUL/EC', 'BUL/SC', 'BLA', 'ANK', 'SMY']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let me analyze the game state and develop a strategic plan step by step:

## Strategic Analysis

0. Negotiation Phase Recap:
- No explicit negotiation context was provided in the previous state

1. Current State Analysis:
- Italy Controls:
  * Supply Centers: NAP, ROM, VEN, TRI, GRE
  * Units: A VEN, A GRE, A TRI, F TYS, F ION
  * Strategic Position: Strong Mediterranean presence

- Turkey Controls:
  * Supply Centers: ANK, CON, SMY, MOS, RUM
  * Units: F CON, F BLA, A ARM, A ANK
  * Strategic Position: Strong eastern control

2. Strategic Goals:
- Expand territorial control
- Target vulnerable supply centers
- Maintain Mediterranean dominance
- Potential collaboration with Turkey against other powers

3. Unit Analysis and Potential Moves:

For Italy:
- A GRE: Potential moves to support expansion
- A TRI: Can potentially move towards Austria's territory
- A VEN: Flexible position for attacks
- F ION: Strong naval positioning
- F TYS: Good for supporting Mediterranean operations

For Turkey:
- A ANK: Potential move towards expansion
- A ARM: Strategic position for potential attacks
- F BLA: Strong naval presence
- F CON: Good positioning for support

4. Potential Attack Strategies:
- Potential target: Austria's territories (BUD, VIE)
- Possible expansion into Mediterranean regions
- Coordinate with Turkey for joint operations

5. Specific Strategic Considerations:
- Ensure supported attacks
- Maintain defensive positions
- Create opportunities for future expansion

## Detailed Strategic Plan

Based on the analysis, here's a strategic JSON plan:

{
    "phase": "F1905M",
    "reason": "Coordinate Italian and Turkish forces to expand territorial control, targeting Austrian territories and creating strategic opportunities in the Mediterranean",

        {"TRI": ["ADR", "ALB", "BUD", "SER", "TYR", "VEN", "VIE"]},
        {"ANK": ["ARM", "BLA", "CON", "SMY"]}
    ],
    "other_power_location": ["BUD", "VIE", "SER"],

        {"supporter": "F ION", "supported": "A TRI", "target": "SER"},
        {"supporter": "A ARM", "supported": "A ANK", "target": "CON"}
    ],
    "attack_mask": {
        "ITALY": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
        "TURKEY": [1, 1, 0, 0]
    },
    "orders": {
        "ITALY": [
            "A TRI - SER",
            "A GRE S A TRI - SER",
            "F ION S A TRI - SER",
            "A VEN H",
            "F TYS H"
        ],
        "TURKEY": [
            "A ANK - CON",
            "A ARM S A ANK - CON",
            "F BLA S A ANK - CON",
            "F CON H"
        ]
    }
}

Strategic Reasoning:
1. Italy attempts to take SER from Austria, with support from A GRE and F ION
2. Turkey attempts to take CON, supported by A ARM and F BLA
3. Maintaining defensive positions in other territories
4. Creating opportunities for future expansion

The strategy focuses on coordinated attacks, maintaining strategic depth, and setting up future moves while minimizing risk.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Alright, let's break this down step by step, considering the current state of the game and the possible moves available to us as Austria and England.

### Step 0: Recap Information
Since no prior negotiation phase details are provided, let's focus purely on strategic positioning and potential moves based on the current game state.

### Step 1: Analyze Current State

- **Austria**: 
  - Units: A BUD, A SER, F SMY
  - Supply Centers: BUD, VIE, SER
  - Influenced Regions: BUD, VIE, ALB, EAS, SER, SMY

- **England**: 
  - Units: F IRI, F ENG, A WAL
  - Supply Centers: LON, LVP, STP
  - Influenced Regions: LON, IRI, YOR, LVP, ENG, WAL

- **Other Powers**:
  - Consider the positions and potential moves of neighboring powers, particularly those that could threaten our regions or where we might expand.

### Step 2: Plan to Take More Supply Centers

- **Targets for Austria**: 
  - SMY is isolated and could be a target for Turkey, potentially reinforce or reposition.
  - Push for RUM to gain another supply center.

- **Targets for England**: 
  - Expand influence towards the continent. Capture BEL or PIC.
  - Defend and possibly expand in the direction of France by moving into BRE.

### Step 3: Possible Orders Analysis

**Austria:**

1. **A BUD**: 
   - Possible Orders: We could support A RUM or move to VIE or RUM.
   - Strategy: Support A RUM to strengthen position and exert pressure on RUS.

2. **A SER**: 
   - Possible Orders: Move to ALB or TRI, or support A BUL or RUM.
   - Strategy: Move to TRI to expand our influence.

3. **F SMY**: 
   - Possible Orders: Move to CON, SYR, or AEG.
   - Strategy: Move to CON to strengthen naval presence.

**England:**

1. **F ENG**: 
   - Possible Orders: Move to BEL or BRE, support WAL, or convoy.
   - Strategy: Move to BRE to exert pressure on France and expand.

2. **F IRI**: 
   - Possible Orders: Move to LVP, ENG, WAL, or MAO.
   - Strategy: Move to MAO to control sea routes.

3. **A WAL**: 
   - Possible Orders: Move to BEL or LON, or support F NAO.
   - Strategy: Move to BEL to take control from Germany.

### Step 4: Make Order Decisions

**Austria**:
- A BUD - RUM
- A SER - TRI
- F SMY - CON

**England**:
- F ENG - BRE
- F IRI - MAO
- A WAL - BEL

### Step 5: Verification and Finalization

- Ensure all movements are towards non-controlled regions and adjacent regions.
- Appropriate support is available for actions needing reinforcement.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>
{'FRANCE': {'BRE': ['F BRE S A PAR - PIC', 'F BRE S A PAR - GAS', 'F BRE - PIC', 'F BRE S F ENG - PIC', 'F BRE S A SPA - GAS', 'F BRE - MAO', 'F BRE S A WAL - PIC', 'F BRE S A GAS', 'F BRE S F IRI - ENG', 'F BRE - GAS', 'F BRE S F NAO - MAO', 'F BRE H', 'F BRE S F ENG', 'F BRE - ENG', 'F BRE S F ENG - MAO', 'F BRE S A BEL - PIC', 'F BRE S F IRI - MAO'], 'GAS': ['A GAS S A SPA - MAR', 'A GAS H', 'A GAS S F ENG - BRE', 'A GAS - BUR', 'A GAS S A BEL - BUR', 'A GAS S F BRE', 'A GAS S A BEL - BRE', 'A GAS - SPA', 'A GAS S A PAR - BUR', 'A GAS S A PAR - BRE', 'A GAS S A PAR', 'A GAS - BRE', 'A GAS S A RUH - BUR', 'A GAS S A SPA', 'A GAS - MAR', 'A GAS S A PIE - MAR', 'A GAS S A WAL - BRE', 'A GAS - PAR', 'A GAS S A MUN - BUR'], 'PAR': ['A PAR S A RUH - BUR', 'A PAR S A BEL - BUR', 'A PAR S A GAS - BRE', 'A PAR S A WAL - BRE', 'A PAR S F BRE', 'A PAR S A BEL - PIC', 'A PAR S F BRE - GAS', 'A PAR S F ENG - PIC', 'A PAR - BRE', 'A PAR H', 'A PAR - BUR', 'A PAR S A BEL - BRE', 'A PAR - GAS', 'A PAR S A GAS - BUR', 'A PAR S F ENG - BRE', 'A PAR S F BRE - PIC', 'A PAR S A GAS', 'A PAR S A MUN - BUR', 'A PAR - PIC', 'A PAR S A SPA - GAS', 'A PAR S A WAL - PIC'], 'PIE': ['A PIE S A GRE - TUS', 'A PIE S A TUS', 'A PIE H', 'A PIE S A TRI - TYR', 'A PIE S A VEN - TUS', 'A PIE S A VEN - TYR', 'A PIE - TUS', 'A PIE - TYR', 'A PIE S A TRI - VEN', 'A PIE S A TUS - VEN', 'A PIE S A GAS - MAR', 'A PIE - MAR', 'A PIE S F TYS - TUS', 'A PIE S A VEN', 'A PIE S A MUN - TYR', 'A PIE S A SPA - MAR', 'A PIE - VEN'], 'SPA': ['A SPA S F BRE - GAS', 'A SPA S A GAS', 'A SPA S A PIE - MAR', 'A SPA S A PAR - GAS', 'A SPA - POR', 'A SPA H', 'A SPA S A GAS - MAR', 'A SPA - GAS', 'A SPA - MAR']}}
</possible_orders>

### **Your Objective:**

Your ultimate goal is absolute domination—seize every supply center and crush your opposition to win! Build and expand relentlessly, taking control of regions by launching bold, decisive attacks, control as many supply center as you can. Strike hard, strike fast, and let nothing stand in your way. Victory belongs to the bold—go conquer it!

Now please think step by step in your response, and provide the JSON object with your strategic reasoning and orders.

There are no neutral powers in this game.
This is the build/disband phase. You can build new units in your home centers, or disband units if you have too many. Remember, you need to control enough supply centers to win.

Please respond with a JSON object like:
{
"reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
"orders": {
    "FRANCE": ["F BRE B", "A PAR B", ...],

}
}

Where "orders" is a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of each location's decision. For each location, you can only issue one order. The length of the list of each power should match the number of locations for which you can issue orders.

The string should be able to be parsed to json str. So don't use special characters like \n, \t, etc. Generate the text with standard straight double quotes. Do not add comments inside the output! 
The possible orders you can issue are as follows:
{'AUSTRIA': {}, 'ENGLAND': {}}
Remember, you need to reach the configured number of supply centers (build more and more supply centers) to win.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],

    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

**Strategic Reasoning for Russia's Fall 1906 Moves:**

Russia's goal for the Fall of 1906 is to consolidate power and expand influence by focusing on securing additional supply centers and strengthening defenses. With control over key territories like Sweden, Bulgaria, Rumania, Ukraine, and Sevastopol, there is an opportunity to both defend current assets and strategically attack to disrupt the positions of neighboring powers.

**Current Analysis and Strategy:**

- **Defensive Strategy:**
  - Strengthen the defense of Sevastopol. This is crucial given its proximity to hostile Turkish forces in Armenia.
  - Maintain a strong presence in Sweden to deter German advances from Norway.

- **Offensive Strategy:**
  - A critical focus will be on Bulgaria and its surrounding regions. There are multiple neighboring powers, making it a hotspot for action.
  - Consider advancing into strategic regions like Serbia or Greece if opportunities arise, potentially destabilizing the Balkans further.

**Order Planning:**

1. **Bulgaria (BUL):** 
    - This unit has a pivotal role in securing the south. Consider moving to Serbia if the analysis suggests it's lightly defended. Otherwise, hold or support adjacent moves to maintain regional stability.

2. **Rumania (RUM):**
    - Key for controlling the Black Sea and supporting moves into the Balkans or countering moves from Turkey. Support actions from Sevastopol might be necessary.

3. **Sevastopol (SEV):**
    - Primarily a defensive unit this turn. Its role will be to offer support to Rumania or counter moves from the Black Sea.

4. **Sweden (SWE):**
    - Should focus on supporting defensive operations or making a strategic move against Norway if it appears vulnerable.

5. **Ukraine (UKR):**
    - Acts as a supporting unit for operations in Rumania or offensive moves into surrounding territories like Galicia if the situation allows.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let me think through this strategically step by step:

0. Negotiation Recap
- No specific previous negotiation details were provided
- Need to focus on strategic expansion and opportunity

1. Game State Analysis
Italy's Current Position:
- Controlled Supply Centers: NAP, VEN, TRI, GRE, SER (5 total)
- Units: A GRE, A SER, F ION, F TYS, A VEN
- Current territories indicate potential for Balkan and Mediterranean expansion

Other Powers' Positions:
- Austria seems weakened with limited units
- Russia has potential Balkan interests
- Turkey controls strategic Black Sea region

2. Strategic Goals
- Expand influence in Balkans
- Potentially attack Austria or weaken Russia
- Secure Mediterranean control
- Position for future supply center acquisitions

3. Unit Analysis and Potential Orders
A GRE (Greece):
- Potential moves: BUL, SER, ALB
- Support opportunities with Serbia

F ION (Ionian Sea):
- Support movements
- Convoy capabilities
- Potential moves to ADR, AEG, ALB

A SER (Serbia):
- Potential moves: BUD, TRI, ALB, BUL, RUM
- Strong support position

A VEN (Venice):
- Potential moves: TRI, APU, ROM
- Support opportunities

F TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea):
- Support Mediterranean movements
- Potential moves to WES, LYO, NAP

4. Specific Strategic Considerations
- Serbia looks like a key strategic point
- Can potentially support moves into Bulgarian or Romanian territories
- Mediterranean fleet positioning is crucial
- Need to create pressure without overextending

5. Proposed Strategy
- Use Serbia as a support hub
- Position Greek army to potentially enter Bulgaria
- Use Ionian Fleet for strategic support/convoy
- Maintain defensive positioning while creating expansion opportunities

After careful analysis, here's my proposed JSON strategy:

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let's proceed step by step according to your instructions.

### Step 0: Recap Negotiations
Unfortunately, there are no notes provided for the past negotiations, so I'll have to make assumptions based on the current game state.

### Step 1: Analyze the Current State
#### Austria
- **Units:**
  - A BUD (Army in Budapest)
  - F SMY (Fleet in Smyrna)
  - A ALB (Army in Albania)
- **Supply Centers:** BUD, VIE, SMY
- **Objective:** Maintain control and possibly expand into Balkans.

#### England
- **Units:**
  - F IRI (Fleet in Irish Sea)
  - F ENG (Fleet in English Channel)
  - A WAL (Army in Wales)
- **Supply Centers:** LON, LVP, STP
- **Objective:** Protect home centers and look for opportunities to expand towards Europe.

### Step 2: Goal is Control of Supply Centers
- **Austria:** Potential targets include GRE (Greece) and TRI (Trieste), both held by Italy.
- **England:** Maintain control of home centers and potentially target BEL (Belgium) or BRE (Brest).

### Step 3: Analyze Orders

#### Austria's Possible Orders
1. **A ALB**
   - Potential moves: SER (Serbia), TRI (Trieste), GRE (Greece)
   - **Plan:** Move to SER to possibly take control or support other units for better strategic positioning.

2. **A BUD**
   - Potential moves: SER, RUM (Romania), TRI
   - **Plan:** Support potential moves from ALB to SER, increasing influence in Balkans.

3. **F SMY**
   - Potential moves: CON (Constantinople), AEG (Aegean Sea)
   - **Plan:** Move towards AEG for strategic positioning and potential future attacks.

#### England's Possible Orders
1. **F ENG**
   - Potential moves: BRE, BEL
   - **Plan:** Move to BRE, potentially take control from France, or support an army in WAL.

2. **F IRI**
   - Potential moves: LVP, ENG
   - **Plan:** Support ENG or engage defensively to protect interests.

3. **A WAL**
   - Potential moves: LON, BEL
   - **Plan:** Move to LON for strategic repositioning or support ENG.

### Step 4: Make Decisions
- **Austria:**
  - Move A ALB to SER to increase influence.
  - Support from A BUD to SER.
  - Move F SMY to AEG to increase naval control.

- **England:**
  - Move F ENG to BRE for potential control.
  - Support F IRI to ENG to maintain sea dominance.
  - Move A WAL to LON for strategic repositioning.

### Step 5: Verification
- **Ensure attacking only other powers' regions.**
- **Ensure moves are to adjacent regions.**
- **Ensure moves/supplies are correct.**

The orders are verified, and all moves, supports, and strategies align with goals and capabilities.

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],

### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.

    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",

        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

To strategize effectively in Diplomacy, especially in the given scenario for fall 1906 as Russia, we need to evaluate our current position, potential threats, and opportunities for expansion. Let’s break down the situation and propose a strategic plan followed by orders.

### Strategic Analysis:
1. **Current Control and Position**: 
   - You control the supply centers in Warsaw (WAR), Sevastopol (SEV), Bulgaria (BUL), and Rumania (RUM). 
   - Your units are positioned in Bulgaria (A), Rumania (A), Ukraine (A), Sevastopol (F), and Skagerrak (F).

2. **Adjacent Threats and Opportunities**:
   - **Sevastopol**: Proximity to Turkish units could pose a threat. Could support into Armenia or Rumania.
   - **Ukraine**: Central location provides flexibility; can support moves into Rumania or defend against possible threats from Galicia.
   - **Bulgaria**: Positioned well for an advance into Greece or to support moves into Rumania or Serbia, holding a key position against Turkish advancement.
   - **Skagerrak**: Positioned to potentially move into Swedish regions or support moves in adjacent seas.

3. **Strategic Goals**:
   - **Secure and Defend**: Strengthen control over current territories, particularly against Turkish moves.
   - **Expand**: Aim to take control of Greece, leveraging Bulgaria, and prepare to support an attack on Norway from Skagerrak if possible.

### Orders Proposal:

Based on the strategy, here are the proposed orders:

```json
{
    "phase": "F1906M",
    "reason": "As Russia in Fall 1906, the strategy focuses on defending existing territories while also looking to expand into Greece for an additional supply center. Coordination of fleet in Skagerrak aims to explore opportunities in the north without leaving it inactive.",
    "my_location": ["WAR", "SEV", "BUL", "RUM", "UKR", "SKA"],
    "my_unit": ["A BUL", "A RUM", "A UKR", "F SEV", "F SKA"],
    "adjacent": [
        {"RUM": ["BLA", "BUD", "BUL/EC", "GAL", "SER", "SEV", "UKR"]},
        {"SEV": ["ARM", "BLA", "MOS", "RUM", "UKR"]},
        {"SKA": ["DEN", "NWY", "NTH", "SWE"]},
        {"UKR": ["GAL", "MOS", "RUM", "SEV", "WAR"]}
    ],
    "other_power_location": ["GRE", "SER", "ARM", "GAL", "NWY"],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 0, 1, 0],
    "attackable": ["GRE", "SER", "ARM", "NWY"],
    "attack_analysis": [{"GRE": 2}, {"NWY": 1}],
    "support_given": [
        {"supporter": "A BUL", "supported": "A RUM", "target": "SER"},
        {"supporter": "F SEV", "supported": "A RUM", "target": "ARM"}
    ],
    "attack_mask": {
        "SER": [1, 0, 0],
        "ARM": [1, 0, 0]
    },
    "orders": {
        "RUSSIA": [
            "A BUL S A RUM - SER",
            "A RUM - SER",
            "A UKR S A RUM - SER",
            "F SEV S A RUM - ARM",
            "F SKA - DEN"
        ]
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Bulgaria**: Supports Rumania to attack Serbia.
- **Rumania**: Moves to Serbia to attempt to capture the supply center.
- **Ukraine**: Supports the move from Rumania to Serbia, strengthening the attack.
- **Sevastopol**: Supports a move from Rumania to Armenia, preparing for defensive maneuvers.
- **Skagerrak**: Moves to Denmark, seeking to expand influence in Scandinavia and potentially setting up for a future move into Norway.

This strategy hinges on consolidating power in the Balkans while cautiously probing opportunities in the north, keeping the fleet active. Such moves should ensure a balance between defense and assertive expansion.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

     * F ION (Ionian Sea)
     * A SER (Serbia)
     * A TRI (Trieste)
     * F TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea)
   
   Potential Strategic Observations:
   - Surrounded by multiple powers (Austria, Turkey, Russia)
   - Good naval position with ION and TYS fleets
   - Centrally located with opportunities for expansion

2. Strategic Goals:
   - Expand control of supply centers
   - Create strategic positioning for future moves
   - Potentially weaken neighboring powers

3. Unit Analysis and Potential Moves:

   A GRE (Greece):
   - Can support moves to BUL or SER
   - Potential convoy opportunities
   
   F ION (Ionian Sea):
   - Excellent position for convoying
   - Can support moves to ALB, NAP, TUN
   
   A SER (Serbia):
   - Can support moves to BUL, ALB, RUM
   
   A TRI (Trieste):
   - Can potentially move to VEN or ALB
   
   F TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea):
   - Can convoy, support moves to NAP, ROM, TUN

4. Potential Strategic Move:
   - Convoy A GRE to a strategic location
   - Support moves to expand influence in Balkans
   - Potentially disrupt Russian or Austrian plans

            "A TRI H",
            "F TYS H"
        ]
    }
}

Key Strategic Rationale:
1. Attempt to capture Bulgaria by convoying and supporting
2. Create a convoy to Albania as a secondary objective
3. Hold Trieste and Tyrrhenian Sea to maintain defensive posture
4. Maximize support for Bulgarian campaign

The plan aims to expand Italian influence in the Balkans while maintaining a defensive stance in other regions. By supporting the move to Bulgaria and convoying to Albania, we create pressure on Russian and Austrian territories.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let's start by analyzing the game state and devising a strategic plan for AUSTRIA and ENGLAND.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 0. Recall Negotiations
I don't have any specific past negotiation details, so I'll base the strategy on position and potential threats.

#### 1. Analyze Current State
- **AUSTRIA:**
  - **Units**: A BUD, A ALB, F AEG
  - **Supply Centers**: BUD, VIE, SMY
  - **Current Influence**: Controlled regions include BUD, VIE, EAS, SMY, ALB, AEG
- **ENGLAND:**
  - **Units**: F IRI, F BRE, A LON
  - **Supply Centers**: LON, LVP, STP
  - **Current Influence**: Controlled regions include IRI, YOR, ENG, WAL, BRE, LON

#### 2. Strategic Goal
- Increase the number of supply centers.
- Protect current supply centers from potential threats.
- Austria: Expand in the Balkans and potentially into Turkey and Italy.
- England: Strengthen positions in western Europe, potentially push against France or Germany.

#### 3. Possible Orders Analysis
- **AUSTRIA:**
  - **A BUD**: Neighboring RUM could be a target, but RUS has strong presence. TRI is also a key strategic position for Austria.
  - **A ALB**: ALB can support operations in the Balkans or potentially move into adjacent regions like GRE.
  - **F AEG**: Has many support and convoy options, crucial for assisting land operations.

- **ENGLAND:**
  - **F BRE**: Can support land operations in France or move to provide naval dominance.
  - **F IRI**: Naval movement is key, possibly support or move against France.
  - **A LON**: Can secure England's position by moving into nearby areas or supporting naval units.

#### 4 & 5. Decision and Verification
Let's develop a coherent strategy, ensuring our moves are legal and aligned with our goals.

### Explanation:
- **AUSTRIA**: Push from BUD to TRI with support from ALB to reinforce our position in the Balkans. Secure position in GRE with naval support from AEG.
- **ENGLAND**: Move F BRE to ENG with support from F IRI, increasing naval control. Move A LON to WAL to strengthen land presence.

This plan focuses on expanding control while maintaining strong defensive positions, leveraging Austria's and England's current strengths.

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'BUR': ['BEL', 'GAS', 'RUH', 'MAR', 'MUN', 'PAR', 'PIC', 'SWI']}, {'GAS': ['BUR', 'BRE', 'MAO', 'mar', 'PAR', 'SPA/NC']}, {'MAR': ['BUR', 'gas', 'LYO', 'PIE', 'SPA/SC', 'SWI']}, {'PIC': ['BEL', 'BRE', 'BUR', 'ENG', 'PAR']}, {'PIE': ['LYO', 'MAR', 'TUS', 'TYR', 'ven', 'SWI']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'GRE': ['AEG', 'ALB', 'BUL/SC', 'ION', 'SER']}, {'ION': ['ADR', 'AEG', 'ALB', 'APU', 'EAS', 'GRE', 'NAP', 'TUN', 'TYS']}, {'SER': ['ALB', 'BUD', 'BUL', 'GRE', 'RUM', 'TRI']}, {'TRI': ['ADR', 'ALB', 'BUD', 'SER', 'TYR', 'VEN', 'VIE']}, {'TYS': ['ION', 'LYO', 'ROM', 'NAP', 'TUN', 'TUS', 'WES']}, {'ARM': ['ANK', 'BLA', 'SEV', 'smy', 'syr']}, {'BLA': ['ANK', 'ARM', 'BUL/EC', 'CON', 'RUM', 'SEV']}, {'CON': ['AEG', 'BUL/EC', 'BUL/SC', 'BLA', 'ANK', 'SMY']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

I'll analyze the current game state step by step for Italy and Turkey:

## Strategic Analysis

0. Negotiation Recap:
   - No specific prior negotiations noted in the game state
   - Current situation suggests potential opportunities for expansion

1. Current State Analysis:
   Italy:
   - Current Supply Centers: NAP, VEN, TRI, GRE, SER (5 centers)
   - Units: A GRE, F TYS, F ION, A SER, A TRI
   - Strategic Position: Controlling Balkans, strong naval presence in Mediterranean

   Turkey:
   - Current Supply Centers: ANK, CON, MOS (3 centers)
   - Units: F CON, F BLA, A ARM
   - Strategic Position: Defensive posture, limited expansion options

2. Strategic Objectives:
   - Italy: Expand in Balkans, potentially target Austria or Russia
   - Turkey: Secure existing territories, prepare for potential defensive moves

3. Unit Analysis and Possible Moves:

Italy:
- A GRE: Potential to support moves into Balkans
- F ION: Strong naval positioning for convoys or support
- A SER: Well-positioned in Balkans
- F TYS: Mediterranean control
- A TRI: Potential to move against Austria

Turkey:
- A ARM: Could support moves or potentially attack
- F BLA: Strategic Black Sea positioning
- F CON: Defensive position

4. Potential Strategic Moves:

Italy:
- Push into Bulgarian regions
- Support movement in Balkan area
- Potentially convoy or support attacks

Turkey:
- Secure Black Sea region
- Potential support for Bulgarian moves
- Defensive positioning

## Detailed Strategic Reasoning

Given the current board state, I'll craft a strategy focusing on:
1. Securing Balkan territories
2. Preparing for potential expansion
3. Maintaining defensive positions

        ]
    }
}

Reasoning:
1. Italy attempts to move into Bulgaria with strong support from Serbia and the Ionian Fleet
2. Turkey provides additional support to the Bulgarian move
3. Maintaining defensive positions with other units
4. Potential to expand territorial control in the Balkans
5. Coordinated move between Italy and Turkey to maximize chances of success

The strategy aims to:
- Secure Bulgarian territory
- Maintain existing supply centers
- Create a cooperative approach between Italy and Turkey
- Prepare for potential future expansion

This approach balances offensive potential with defensive positioning, seeking to incrementally expand territorial control while maintaining strategic flexibility.

There are no neutral powers in this game.

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'AEG': ['BUL/SC', 'CON', 'EAS', 'GRE', 'ION', 'SMY']}, {'ALB': ['ADR', 'GRE', 'ION', 'SER', 'TRI']}, {'BUD': ['GAL', 'RUM', 'SER', 'TRI', 'VIE']}, {'BRE': ['ENG', 'GAS', 'MAO', 'PAR', 'PIC']}, {'IRI': ['ENG', 'LVP', 'MAO', 'NAO', 'WAL']}, {'LON': ['ENG', 'NTH', 'YOR', 'WAL']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

To begin, let's review the game situation and develop a strategy based on the instructions provided.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 0: Recap Negotiation Phase
The negotiation phase details are not provided, so we’ll rely on the game state and current positioning.

#### Step 1: Analyze Current State
- **Austria**: Controls BUD, VIE, SMY. Units in BUD, ALB, and AEG.
- **England**: Controls LON, LVP, STP. Units in IRI, BRE, and LON.

#### Step 2: Supply Center Goals
- **Austria**: Aim to secure nearby supply centers. Potential targets: SER (currently controlled by Italy), GRE.
- **England**: Maintain control over current supply centers and potentially disrupt France and Germany in Western Europe.

#### Step 3: Possible Orders for each Unit

**Austria:**
- **F AEG**: Support movements around Greece or prepare for future movements into the Eastern Mediterranean.
- **A ALB**: Potentially move to GRE or support actions in TRI.
- **A BUD**: Support ALB or secure strategic positioning in SER/RUM.

**England:**
- **F IRI**: Maintain control over the Irish Sea or support actions in the English Channel.
- **F BRE**: Consider moving into the English Channel (ENG) or supporting actions in GAS.
- **A LON**: Move toward WAL or YOR to project power over central England.

#### Step 4: Order Decision
- **Austria**: Focus on consolidation and support actions.
- **England**: Consider aggressive movements towards France or consolidation in ENG.

#### Step 5: Verification and Revised Orders
Check each move to ensure they align with strategic goals and rules:

### Detailed Order Plan

**Strategic Reasoning:**
- **Austria**: Focus on securing the Eastern Mediterranean and supporting units around Greece to maintain influence.
- **England**: Maintain a strong presence in Western Europe, considering moves that project power over ENG and GAS.

### Explanation:
- **Austria's Orders**: 
  - **F AEG moves to GRE**: Strengthens influence in the Eastern Mediterranean.
  - **A ALB supports F AEG to GRE**: Provides support to ensure movement.
  - **A BUD moves to SER**: Secures more control in the Balkans.

- **England's Orders**:
  - **F BRE moves to ENG**: Positions England to impact Western Europe control.
  - **F IRI supports F BRE to ENG**: Ensures successful movement.
  - **A LON moves to YOR**: Positions to project power in central England.

The moves align with the strategic intent of controlling and expanding influence over critical regions and supply centers.

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.

5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>
{'FRANCE': {'BUR': ['A BUR - PAR', 'A BUR S A GAS', 'A BUR - RUH', 'A BUR S A PAR', 'A BUR - PIC', 'A BUR S A GAS - MAR', 'A BUR S F PIC - BEL', 'A BUR S A RUH - BEL', 'A BUR S F BRE - PIC', 'A BUR S A MUN - RUH', 'A BUR - BEL', 'A BUR S A PIE - MAR', 'A BUR H', 'A BUR S A MAR - GAS', 'A BUR S A RUH - MUN', 'A BUR S A RUH', 'A BUR S A PAR - GAS', 'A BUR S A GAS - PAR', 'A BUR S A MAR', 'A BUR - GAS', 'A BUR S A MUN', 'A BUR S F PIC', 'A BUR - MAR', 'A BUR S F BRE - GAS', 'A BUR - MUN', 'A BUR S A KIE - RUH', 'A BUR S A KIE - MUN', 'A BUR S A PAR - PIC'], 'GAS': ['A GAS S A MUN - BUR', 'A GAS S A PAR - BUR', 'A GAS - BRE', 'A GAS - MAR', 'A GAS S A BUR', 'A GAS S A BUR - PAR', 'A GAS H', 'A GAS S A BUR - MAR', 'A GAS - SPA', 'A GAS S A MAR - BUR', 'A GAS S A PIE - MAR', 'A GAS S A RUH - BUR', 'A GAS - PAR', 'A GAS - BUR', 'A GAS S F BRE', 'A GAS S A MAR - SPA', 'A GAS S F PIC - BRE', 'A GAS S A MAR', 'A GAS S A PAR - BRE', 'A GAS S A PAR'], 'MAR': ['A MAR S A BUR', 'A MAR S A GAS', 'A MAR S A BUR - GAS', 'A MAR S A TUS - PIE', 'A MAR S A MUN - BUR', 'A MAR - GAS', 'A MAR S A PAR - BUR', 'A MAR S A PIE', 'A MAR S A RUH - BUR', 'A MAR - SPA', 'A MAR S A GAS - SPA', 'A MAR S A GAS - BUR', 'A MAR S A PAR - GAS', 'A MAR - BUR', 'A MAR H', 'A MAR S F BRE - GAS', 'A MAR - PIE'], 'PIC': ['F PIC S F BRE', 'F PIC S A PAR - BRE', 'F PIC H', 'F PIC S A BUR - BEL', 'F PIC S A GAS - BRE', 'F PIC - BRE', 'F PIC S A RUH - BEL', 'F PIC S F IRI - ENG', 'F PIC S F BRE - ENG', 'F PIC - ENG', 'F PIC - BEL'], 'PIE': ['A PIE H', 'A PIE S F TYS - TUS', 'A PIE - TYR', 'A PIE S A TUS - VEN', 'A PIE S A TUS', 'A PIE S A ALB - TUS', 'A PIE S A BUL - TUS', 'A PIE S A TRI - TYR', 'A PIE S A MUN - TYR', 'A PIE S A MAR', 'A PIE S A GAS - MAR', 'A PIE S A GRE - TUS', 'A PIE - VEN', 'A PIE - TUS', 'A PIE S A TRI - VEN', 'A PIE - MAR', 'A PIE S A BUR - MAR']}}
</possible_orders>

### **Your Objective:**

Your ultimate goal is absolute domination—seize every supply center and crush your opposition to win! Build and expand relentlessly, taking control of regions by launching bold, decisive attacks, control as many supply center as you can. Strike hard, strike fast, and let nothing stand in your way. Victory belongs to the bold—go conquer it!

Now please think step by step in your response, and provide the JSON object with your strategic reasoning and orders.

[{'AEG': ['BUL/SC', 'CON', 'EAS', 'GRE', 'ION', 'SMY']}, {'ALB': ['ADR', 'GRE', 'ION', 'SER', 'TRI']}, {'BUD': ['GAL', 'RUM', 'SER', 'TRI', 'VIE']}, {'BRE': ['ENG', 'GAS', 'MAO', 'PAR', 'PIC']}, {'IRI': ['ENG', 'LVP', 'MAO', 'NAO', 'WAL']}, {'LON': ['ENG', 'NTH', 'YOR', 'WAL']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>

Let's go through the process step by step:

### 0. Recap Negotiation Phase
- As we have no specific context from the negotiation phase for F1906M, we'll focus solely on the current game state for our strategy.

### 1. Analyze Current State

- **Austria:**
  - Units: A BUD, A ALB, F AEG
  - Supply Centers: 3 (BUD, VIE, SMY)
- **England:**
  - Units: F IRI, F BRE, A LON
  - Supply Centers: 3 (LON, LVP, STP)

- **Strategic Location Analysis:**
  - Austria is positioned to influence the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean.
  - England controls important coastal positions and has a foothold in Brest, which provides leverage against France.

### 2. Plan to Expand Control of Supply Centers

- Austria could push into Italy or consolidate control in the Balkans.
- England might want to press into France further or protect its positions in England.

### 3. Analyze Possible Orders

#### Austria
- **F AEG:**
  - Potential actions: Support moves/holds, convoy, or relocate to SMY or ION.
  - Strategic choice: Use AEG to support an aggressive push into Greece or act defensively. Move to SMY could deny enemy leverage there.

- **A ALB:**
  - Potential actions: Move to support Greece or Serbia or shift to Trieste or Greece.
  - Strategic choice: ALB can support a move to Greece or bolster defense in the Balkans.

- **A BUD:**
  - Potential actions: Support a move or consolidation in the Balkans.
  - Strategic choice: Secure the Balkans by shifting to RUM or supporting adjacent units.

#### England
- **F IRI:**
  - Potential actions: Relocate to MAO or engage in the protection of English waters.
  - Strategic choice: Shift to MAO to enhance naval influence or secure the British Isles.

- **F BRE:**
  - Potential actions: Support actions against France or reposition.
  - Strategic choice: Support a move against GAS or MAO to maintain pressure on France.

- **A LON:**
  - Potential actions: Move to expand influence in WAL or fortify England.
  - Strategic choice: Shift to WAL to expand control within the British Isles or support defensive actions.

### 4. Make Order Decisions

- **Austria:**
  - AEG can move to ION, enhancing influence in the sea. ALB should secure GRE if feasible. BUD should aim to control SER.

- **England:**
  - IRI to MAO to control maritime routes. BRE could either support or relocate to GAS for a potential advance.

### 5. Revise and Verify Orders

- We need to ensure compliance with adjacent region rules and check for necessary support in any intended moves.

### Finalizing Orders
Now, formulating the JSON output according to the analysis:

```json
{
    "phase": "F1906M",
    "reason": "Austria is strengthening its hold in the Balkans and pushing into the eastern Mediterranean. England is applying pressure on France and securing maritime dominance.",

    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    "attackable": ["GRE", "SER", "MAO", "GAS"],
    "attack_analysis": [{"GRE": 2}, {"SER": 1}, {"MAO": 1}, {"GAS": 1}],
    "support_given": [],
    "attack_mask": {
        "AUSTRIA": [0, 1, 1],
        "ENGLAND": [1, 0, 0]
    },
    "orders": {
        "AUSTRIA": ["F AEG - ION", "A ALB - GRE", "A BUD - SER"],
        "ENGLAND": ["F IRI - MAO", "F BRE - GAS", "A LON - WAL"]
    }
}
```

This strategic set of orders focuses on expanding Austria’s influence in the Balkans while England pressures France and secures its maritime presence. Let me know if you need any adjustments or further considerations.

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.

    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round?

     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'RUM': ['BLA', 'BUD', 'BUL/EC', 'GAL', 'SER', 'SEV', 'UKR']}, {'SEV': ['ARM', 'BLA', 'MOS', 'RUM', 'UKR']}, {'SKA': ['DEN', 'NWY', 'NTH', 'SWE']}, {'UKR': ['GAL', 'MOS', 'RUM', 'SEV', 'WAR']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],

    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Given the current state and my role as Russia with my units and control over certain supply centers and regions, let's evaluate the situation and devise a strategic set of orders to advance my position in the game.

### Current Position Analysis:
- **Controlled Supply Centers:** WAR, SWE, SEV, BUL, RUM
- **Units:** A BUL, A RUM, F SEV, F SKA, A UKR

### Strategic Goals:
1. **Strengthen Defense:** My position in the Balkans with BUL and RUM is potentially vulnerable to attacks from Turkey, Austria, or the Balkan region itself.
2. **Expand Influence:** Look to increase influence in the Balkans and Black Sea regions by moving towards Turkey and possibly engaging Austria.
3. **Support Current Units:** Ensure that units are positioned to support each other, especially near conflict zones.

### Analysis of Moves and Supports:
- **A BUL:** It is surrounded by potential conflict zones. Provide support to hold or move to influence other areas.
- **A RUM:** Also vulnerable. Should support A BUL and/or F SEV in their actions.
- **F SEV:** Positioned to support movements in Black Sea or support land movements into the Balkans or Turkey.
- **F SKA:** Relatively distant from other action regions. Could be used to support movements or defenses in the North.
- **A UKR:** Can support movements into RUM or potentially move to bolster defenses in surrounding regions.

### Orders for F1906M:
Given the units and their current locations, here are possible orders that focus on defensive posture while preparing for potential expansion.

  "orders": {
    "RUSSIA": ["A BUL H", "A RUM S A BUL", "F SEV S A RUM", "F SKA S F SEV", "A UKR S A RUM"]
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **A BUL H:** Army in Bulgaria holds to defend the supply center.
- **A RUM S A BUL:** Army in Rumania supports Army in Bulgaria. This strengthens defenses against potential attacks from Balkans or Turkey.
- **F SEV S A RUM:** Fleet in Sevastopol supports the Army in Rumania. It provides additional defensive capabilities.
- **F SKA S F SEV:** Fleet in Skagerrak supports Fleet in Sevastopol, reinforcing movements or defensive actions in and around the Black Sea.
- **A UKR S A RUM:** Army in Ukraine supports Army in Rumania, adding another layer of support and defense.

This set of orders aims to consolidate control of key areas while positioning for future offensives depending on the evolving strategic situation.

Where "orders" is a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of each location's decision. For each location, you can only issue one order. The length of the list of each power should match the number of locations for which you can issue orders.

The string should be able to be parsed to json str. So don't use special characters like \n, \t, etc. Generate the text with standard straight double quotes. Do not add comments inside the output! 
The possible orders you can issue are as follows:
{'AUSTRIA': {}, 'ENGLAND': {'BRE': ['F BRE D'], 'LON': ['A LON D'], 'MAO': ['F MAO D']}}
Remember, you need to reach the configured number of supply centers (build more and more supply centers) to win.

[{'AEG': ['BUL/SC', 'CON', 'EAS', 'GRE', 'ION', 'SMY']}, {'ALB': ['ADR', 'GRE', 'ION', 'SER', 'TRI']}, {'BUD': ['GAL', 'RUM', 'SER', 'TRI', 'VIE']}, {'LON': ['ENG', 'NTH', 'YOR', 'WAL']}, {'MAO': ['BRE', 'ENG', 'GAS', 'IRI', 'NAF', 'NAO', 'POR', 'SPA/NC', 'SPA/SC', 'WES']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

### **Your Objective:**

Your ultimate goal is absolute domination—seize every supply center and crush your opposition to win! Build and expand relentlessly, taking control of regions by launching bold, decisive attacks, control as many supply center as you can. Strike hard, strike fast, and let nothing stand in your way. Victory belongs to the bold—go conquer it!

Let's start by analyzing the current situation and then formulating a plan based on the information provided.

### Step 0: Recap Negotiation Phase
Since no specific negotiation phase details are given, I will assume that any prior alliances or conflicts with other powers are standard and based on the typical dynamics of the game. 

### Step 1: Analyze Current State
- **AUSTRIA**:
  - Units: A BUD (Budapest), A ALB (Albania), F AEG (Aegean Sea)
  - Supply Centers: BUD, VIE, SMY
  - Home Centers: BUD, TRI, VIE
  - Influence: BUD, VIE, EAS, SMY, ALB, AEG
  
- **ENGLAND**:
  - Units: A LON (London), F MAO (Mid-Atlantic Ocean)
  - Supply Centers: LON, BRE
  - Home Centers: EDI, LON, LVP
  - Influence: IRI, YOR, ENG, WAL, BRE, LON, MAO

**Other Powers**: 
- France is strongly positioned with units near England's territories and controls strategic regions like BEL and PIC.
- Germany is spread across the northern territories with a strong presence and many units.
- Italy and Turkey have strategic positions in the South and East, respectively.

### Step 2: Strategic Goals
- **AUSTRIA**: 
  - Secure and potentially expand influence in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean.
  - Targeting GRE (Greece) could be strategically important for future influence in the southeast.
  
- **ENGLAND**: 
  - Strengthen control in the Western front.
  - Consider aggressive moves on French-controlled regions like BEL or leverage MAO to control more sea territories or attack coastal supply centers like SPA.

### Step 3: Analyze Possible Orders
#### AUSTRIA
- **F AEG** has several convoy options and can strategically support attacks or hold.
- **A ALB** can move into GRE or support neighboring territories.
- **A BUD** in a strong central position can support neighboring regions or prepare for an attack.

#### ENGLAND
- **A LON** has potential moves towards YOR or other northern regions and can support naval movements.
- **F MAO** can move, support or convoy; capturing coastal supply centers like POR or supporting northern movements.

### Step 4: Decision Making
- **Execute a balanced strategy throughout key regions for both powers.**

### Step 5: Verification and Finalization

Let's formulate a set of potential moves adhering to the game rules and strategic objectives.

    ],
    "attack_mask": {
        "AUSTRIA": [1, 0, 0],
        "ENGLAND": [0, 1]
    },
    "orders": {
        "AUSTRIA": ["F AEG - GRE", "A ALB S F AEG - GRE", "A BUD S A ALB - SER"],
        "ENGLAND": ["A LON - YOR", "F MAO - SPA/SC"]
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **AUSTRIA**:
   - Move F AEG to GRE using support from A ALB to potentially secure GRE.
   - Hold A ALB or prepare to support F AEG's move.
   - Use A BUD to support A ALB to SER as a preparation move.

2. **ENGLAND**:
   - Move A LON to YOR to strengthen northern positioning and get closer to potential German influence zones.
   - Move F MAO to SPA/SC to capture a new supply center from France.

This plan maximizes control potential and strengthens our position for future attacks or defenses.

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### 0. Recap of Negotiation Phase

No notes are provided for this state. Therefore, there are no specific agreements, promises, or threats from the previous negotiation phase to consider in our planning.

---

### 1. Current State Analysis

#### **Our Position (France):**

- **Supply Centers Controlled (5):** MAR, PAR, POR, SPA, BEL
- **Units on the Board:**
  - **Armies:**
    - A PIE (Piedmont)
    - A MAR (Marseilles)
    - A GAS (Gascony)
    - A PIC (Picardy)
  - **Fleet:**
    - F BEL (Belgium)
- **Regions Influenced:** WES, POR, PIE, SPA, MAR, GAS, BEL, PIC

We have 5 supply centers and 5 units, so we are at our unit capacity.

#### **Other Powers:**

- **Germany:**
  - **Units:**
    - A MUN (Munich)
    - A KIE (Kiel)
    - F LVP (Liverpool)
    - A TUS (Tuscany)
    - A RUH (Ruhr)
    - F NTH (North Sea)
    - F STP/NC (St. Petersburg North Coast)
    - A BUR (Burgundy)
    - F BAL (Baltic Sea)
    - A BER (Berlin)
  - **Supply Centers Controlled:** BER, KIE, MUN, HOL, NWY, EDI, DEN, ROM, LVP, STP
- **England:**
  - **Units:**
    - A LON (London)
    - F MAO (Mid-Atlantic Ocean)
  - **Supply Centers Controlled:** LON, BRE
- **Italy:**
  - **Units:**
    - A GRE (Greece)
    - F TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea)
    - F ION (Ionian Sea)
    - A SER (Serbia)
    - A TRI (Trieste)
  - **Supply Centers Controlled:** NAP, VEN, TRI, GRE, SER

---

### 2. Strategic Goals and Planning

Our primary goal is to expand our control over more supply centers. Potential targets include:

- **Burgundy (BUR):** Currently occupied by Germany and adjacent to our units in PIC and MAR.
- **Holland (HOL):** Controlled by Germany and adjacent to our fleet in BEL.
- **Venice (VEN):** An Italian supply center adjacent to our army in PIE.
- **Brest (BRE):** Controlled by England and adjacent to our units in PIC and GAS.

Given Germany's strong presence and the immediate threat it poses, focusing on German territories like BUR and HOL is strategic. Additionally, attempting to seize VEN from Italy could catch them off-guard, expanding our influence in the south.

---

### 3. Possible Orders Analysis

#### **Unit: F BEL (Belgium)**

- **Possible Orders:**
  - **Attack:**
    - `F BEL - HOL` (Move to Holland)
    - `F BEL - ENG` (Move to English Channel)
    - `F BEL - NTH` (Move to North Sea)
  - **Support:**
    - `F BEL S A PIC` (Support Army PIC)
  - **Hold:**
    - `F BEL H` (Hold position)
- **Decision:**
  - **Order:** `F BEL - HOL`
  - **Reasoning:** Attempting to capture Holland, a supply center held by Germany. This move puts pressure on Germany and may disrupt their northern defenses.

#### **Unit: A PIC (Picardy)**

- **Possible Orders:**
  - **Attack:**
    - `A PIC - BUR` (Move to Burgundy)
    - `A PIC - BRE` (Move to Brest)
    - `A PIC - PAR` (Move to Paris)
  - **Support:**
    - `A PIC S A RUH - BUR` (Support German attack?)
  - **Hold:**
    - `A PIC H` (Hold position)
- **Decision:**
  - **Order:** `A PIC - BUR`
  - **Reasoning:** Attack Burgundy to challenge German control. With support from A GAS and A MAR, we have a chance to dislodge the German army in BUR.

#### **Unit: A GAS (Gascony)**

- **Possible Orders:**
  - **Support:**
    - `A GAS S A PIC - BUR` (Support Army PIC moving to BUR)
  - **Attack/Move:**
    - `A GAS - BRE` (Move to Brest)
    - `A GAS - BUR` (Move to Burgundy)
    - `A GAS - PAR` (Move to Paris)
  - **Hold:**
    - `A GAS H` (Hold position)
- **Decision:**
  - **Order:** `A GAS S A PIC - BUR`
  - **Reasoning:** Providing support to A PIC in the attack on Burgundy increases our chances of success.

#### **Unit: A MAR (Marseilles)**

- **Possible Orders:**
  - **Support:**
    - `A MAR S A PIC - BUR` (Support Army PIC moving to BUR)
  - **Attack/Move:**
    - `A MAR - BUR` (Move to Burgundy)
    - `A MAR - GAS` (Move to Gascony)
    - `A MAR - SPA` (Move to Spain)
    - `A MAR - PIE` (Move to Piedmont)
  - **Hold:**
    - `A MAR H` (Hold position)
- **Decision:**
  - **Order:** `A MAR S A PIC - BUR`
  - **Reasoning:** Further supporting the attack on Burgundy maximizes our strength in the assault against Germany.

#### **Unit: A PIE (Piedmont)**

- **Possible Orders:**
  - **Attack/Move:**
    - `A PIE - VEN` (Move to Venice)
    - `A PIE - TYR` (Move to Tyrolia)
    - `A PIE - TUS` (Move to Tuscany)
    - `A PIE - MAR` (Move to Marseilles)
  - **Hold:**
    - `A PIE H` (Hold position)
- **Decision:**
  - **Order:** `A PIE - VEN`
  - **Reasoning:** Attempting to capture Venice, an Italian supply center. Italy's units are distant, and VEN may be unoccupied, providing an opportunity for us to expand in the south.

---

### 4. Verification of Orders

- **All move targets are adjacent to the units making the moves.**
- **We are not moving into our own regions except for strategic attacks.**
- **Attack targets are in regions controlled by other powers (Germany and Italy).**
- **Supports are properly directed to units that are attacking the specified targets.**
- **Our attacks have as much support as possible given our unit positions.**

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],

    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }

     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)

     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).

Let me analyze the game state step by step for Italy and Turkey:

## Strategic Analysis for Italy and Turkey

0. Negotiation Phase Recap:
- Current state suggests complex diplomatic positioning
- No clear explicit agreements visible from the game state

1. Current Position Analysis:
Italy:
- Control 5 supply centers: NAP, VEN, TRI, GRE, SER
- Units: A GRE, F TYS, F ION, A SER, A TRI
- Strategic Position: Mediterranean control, potential expansion routes

Turkey:
- Control 3 supply centers: ANK, CON, MOS
- Units: F CON, F BLA, A ARM
- Strategic Position: Black Sea control, potential eastern expansion

2. Supply Center Strategy:
- Prioritize capturing uncontrolled supply centers
- Potential targets: ROM (Germany), NAP (potentially open), BUD (Austria)
- Need to coordinate Italy and Turkey's moves for maximum expansion

3. Specific Unit Analysis:

Italy:
- A GRE: Potential moves to SER, ALB, BUL
- F ION: Strong naval positioning, can support convoy/movement
- A SER: Can support moves in Balkan region
- A TRI: Potential move to VIE or BUD
- F TYS: Flexible Mediterranean movement

Turkey:
- A ARM: Can move to SEV, SMY, CON
- F BLA: Strong Black Sea control
- F CON: Can support moves in Black Sea and Aegean regions

4. Strategic Objectives:
- Coordinate Italy-Turkey attacks
- Expand into Balkan and Eastern European regions
- Disrupt Austria-Hungary and Germany's positions

5. Potential Moves:

Italy Proposed Moves:
- A GRE -> BUL (supported by F ION)
- F ION -> ALB (supporting convoy/movement)
- A SER -> BUD (potential attack)
- A TRI -> VIE
- F TYS -> ROM

Turkey Proposed Moves:
- A ARM -> SEV
- F BLA -> RUM
- F CON -> AEG

Let me now translate this into a detailed JSON strategy:

        {"supporter": "A SER", "supported": "A TRI", "target": "BUD"}
    ],
    "attack_mask": {
        "ITALY": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
        "TURKEY": [1, 1, 0]
    },
    "orders": {
        "ITALY": [
            "A GRE - BUL",
            "F ION S A GRE - BUL",
            "A SER S A TRI - BUD",
            "A TRI - VIE",
            "F TYS - ROM"
        ],
        "TURKEY": [
            "A ARM - SEV",
            "F BLA - RUM",
            "F CON - AEG"
        ]
    }
}

The strategy focuses on:
1. Italy expanding into Bulgaria
2. Supporting a potential Budapest attack
3. Turkey moving to capture Sevastopol and Romania
4. Disrupting Austria-Hungary's position
5. Creating a coordinated expansion strategy

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the strategy?

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

Given the gameplay information and strategic position as Russia in the Spring 1907 move phase, I need to evaluate my position, goals, vulnerabilities, and opportunities to develop a coherent strategy. Here’s a step-by-step analysis and my orders for this turn:

### Current Position Analysis
- **Supply Centers and Territories Controlled:** I control Warsaw (WAR), Sweden (SWE), Sevastopol (SEV), Bulgaria (BUL), and Romania (RUM).
- **Units in Position:** 
  - Army in Bulgaria (A BUL)
  - Army in Romania (A RUM)
  - Fleet in Sevastopol (F SEV)
  - Fleet in Skagerrak (F SKA)
  - Army in Ukraine (A UKR)

### Strategic Goals
- **Immediate Threats:** Bulgaria and Romania are close to the Balkans where there's a concentration of Austrian and Turkish troops. Maintaining control over Sevastopol is essential due to its strategic positioning and being a home supply center.
- **Expansion Opportunities:** 
  - Northern expansion via Scandinavia using F SKA.
  - Solidifying control in the Black Sea region by reinforcing Sevastopol and pushing into the Balkans or Turkey if opportunities arise.

### Order Planning and Justification

#### 1. **Fleet in Skagerrak (F SKA)**
- **Order:** F SKA - DEN
- **Reasoning:** Move to Denmark (DEN) to strengthen northern control and potentially challenge German control. It opens the possibility of supporting Sweden or attacking Norway.

#### 2. **Army in Bulgaria (A BUL)**
- **Order:** A BUL - SER
- **Reasoning:** Move into Serbia (SER) to challenge Austrian control in the Balkans, which can potentially increase the number of supply centers.

#### 3. **Army in Romania (A RUM)**
- **Order:** A RUM S A BUL - SER
- **Reasoning:** Provide support to the Bulgarian army moving into Serbia. This increases the chances of successfully taking Serbia.

#### 4. **Fleet in Sevastopol (F SEV)**
- **Order:** F SEV - BLA
- **Reasoning:** Move to the Black Sea (BLA) to gain naval superiority in this strategic area, potentially threatening Turkish holdings.

#### 5. **Army in Ukraine (A UKR)**
- **Order:** A UKR S F SEV - BLA
- **Reasoning:** Support the fleet's movement from Sevastopol to the Black Sea, ensuring its success against any potential resistance.

These orders are designed to consolidate power while opening new fronts against vulnerable neighbors, leveraging my current strategic advantages for potential territorial gains.

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

   - For Austria: Seek to gain control of SER and TRI if possible. Consider coordination against Italy or Turkey if advantageous.
   - For England: Focus on securing Iberian Peninsula (POR) or Northern territories like HOL or BEL.

3. **Possible Orders Analysis:**
   - **Austria:**
     - A BUD: Could support A ALB to GRE or attack neighboring regions like RUM or SER.
     - A ALB: Potential to support or move to GRE, SMY, or SER. Consider preparing for future moves against Italy.
     - F GRE: Could hold or support movements into the ION or AEG.

   - **England:**
     - A YOR: Potential to secure LON, EDI, or move towards LVP for strategic positioning.
     - F SPA/SC: Could move to POR or support actions in the WES.

4. **Plan and Verify Orders:**
   - **Austria:**
     - A ALB - GRE: Move to secure GRE and prepare for potential further actions.
     - A BUD S A ALB - GRE: Provide support to ensure a secure move to GRE.
     - F GRE - ION: Move to ION to expand influence in the Mediterranean.

   - **England:**
     - A YOR - LVP: Move towards securing LVP.
     - F SPA/SC - POR: Move to secure POR, completing control over Iberia.

5. **Validation:**
   - Ensure none of the moves target already controlled regions.
   - Confirm that the required support is in place for each move.
   - Moves comply with adjacency and game rules.

Based on the analysis, here's the JSON object with proposed orders:

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],

    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",

     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>

Based on the information provided and the current game scenario, here is a strategic analysis and proposed moves for Russia in the Fall of 1907:

### Strategic Analysis:

- **Current Position:** Russia controls 5 supply centers: Warsaw (WAR), Sweden (SWE), Sevastopol (SEV), Bulgaria (BUL), and Rumania (RUM).
- **Units and their locations:** 
  - Army in Bulgaria (BUL)
  - Army in Rumania (RUM)
  - Fleet in Sevastopol (SEV)
  - Fleet in Skagerrak (SKA)
  - Army in Ukraine (UKR)
  
- **Adjacent Regions Information:**
  - RUM: ['BLA', 'BUD', 'BUL/EC', 'GAL', 'SER', 'SEV', 'UKR']
  - SEV: ['ARM', 'BLA', 'MOS', 'RUM', 'UKR']
  - SKA: ['DEN', 'NWY', 'NTH', 'SWE']
  - UKR: ['GAL', 'MOS', 'RUM', 'SEV', 'WAR']

### Objectives:
- **Secure and Expand Control:** Aim to solidify control over current territories and expand into adjacent strategic targets, particularly focusing on creating a buffer zone around existing supply centers and pushing southward to increase influence in the Balkans.
- **Build Alliances or Support Strategies:** Given the proximity and vulnerability to multiple powers, securing support or non-aggression pacts, particularly with neighboring powers like Turkey and Austria, may be essential.

### Proposed Orders:

1. **Army in Rumania (RUM):**
   - Order: A RUM - BUD
   - Reasoning: Attempt to expand influence towards Central Europe, specifically targeting Budapest (BUD) to increase supply centers and potentially disrupt Austrian control.

2. **Army in Bulgaria (BUL):**
   - Order: A BUL - SER
   - Reasoning: Push further into the Balkans by moving towards Serbia (SER), offering a strategic position against Austria and potentially securing another supply center.

3. **Fleet in Sevastopol (SEV):**
   - Order: F SEV - BLA
   - Reasoning: Move the fleet into the Black Sea (BLA) to support operations against Turkey and secure naval dominance in the region.

4. **Fleet in Skagerrak (SKA):**
   - Order: F SKA - SWE
   - Reasoning: Secure Sweden (SWE) further and prepare for potential conflicts or support to neighboring regions.

5. **Army in Ukraine (UKR):**
   - Order: A UKR - GAL
   - Reasoning: Move into Galicia (GAL) to pressure Austria from the east and create a defensive buffer for Warsaw.

  }
}
```

This plan aims for aggressive expansion to secure and extend Russia’s territorial control while positioning units strategically to support future offensive or defensive actions. Checking and revision are necessary closer to the execution phase to adjust to the evolving diplomatic landscape and responses from other powers.

}

Where "orders" is a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of each location's decision. For each location, you can only issue one order. The length of the list of each power should match the number of locations for which you can issue orders.

The string should be able to be parsed to json str. So don't use special characters like \n, \t, etc. Generate the text with standard straight double quotes. Do not add comments inside the output! 
The possible orders you can issue are as follows:
{'GERMANY': {'BER': ['A BER B', 'F BER B', 'WAIVE'], 'MUN': ['A MUN B', 'WAIVE']}}

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

#### 3. Potential Moves
- **Austria:**
  - **A BUD:**
    - Potentially move to RUM or support actions in neighboring regions.
  - **A GRE:**
    - Possible move to SER or support nearby actions.
  - **F ION:**
    - Move could be strategic in securing southern or eastern territories (e.g., ADR, AEG, NAP).
  - **A VIE:**
    - Moves towards TRI or BOH could be offensive.

- **England:**
  - **A LVP:**
    - Potential moves to WAL or EDI based on current positioning.
  - **F POR:**
    - Could move towards MAO or SPA for expansion.
  - **F LON:**
    - Possible moves to ENG or support actions in coastal areas.

#### 4. Order Decision
Consider attack, hold, and support orders for strategic advantage, ensuring not to attack your own regions.

```

### Explanation:
- **Austria**
  - BUD moves to RUM to seize a strategic position.
  - GRE moves to SER to increase territorial control.
  - ION moving to AEG creates naval dominance in the region.
  - VIE moving to TRI is an offensive maneuver to expand influence.

- **England**
  - LVP to WAL strengthens home base control.
  - POR to MAO is a naval strategy to potentially influence western Europe.
  - LON to ENG secures southern waters.

Ensure all moves are well-coordinated with the strategic goal to maximize territorial advantage. Consider the unpredictability of opponent moves and be flexible with future adjustments.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

### Step 0: Recap of Previous Negotiations

No notes or information about previous negotiations are provided. Therefore, we'll proceed based solely on the current game state and make decisions accordingly.

### Step 1: Analyzing the Current State

**Our Power**: France

**Supply Centers Controlled**: MAR (Marseille), PAR (Paris), SPA (Spain)

**Our Units**:
- **A MAR** (Army in Marseille)
- **A GAS** (Army in Gascony)
- **A PAR** (Army in Paris)

**Regions We Influence or Control**:
- MAR, GAS, PAR, WES (Western Mediterranean Sea), PIE (Piedmont), PIC (Picardy), HEL (Helgoland Bight)

**Adjacent Regions**:
- **A PAR**: BUR (Burgundy), BRE (Brest), GAS (Gascony), PIC (Picardy)
- **A GAS**: BUR, BRE, MAO (Mid-Atlantic Ocean), MAR, PAR, SPA/NC (North Coast of Spain)
- **A MAR**: BUR, GAS, LYO (Gulf of Lyon), PIE, SPA/SC (South Coast of Spain), SWI (Switzerland)

**Other Powers' Units Adjacent to Us**:
- **Germany**:
  - **A BUR** (Army in Burgundy)
  - **A BRE** (Army in Brest)
  - **F MAO** (Fleet in Mid-Atlantic Ocean)

**Potential Threats**:
- Germany is our immediate threat with units adjacent to our territories.
- We have lost control of BRE (Brest), our home supply center, now occupied by Germany.
- Germany could potentially launch attacks on PAR (Paris) or GAS (Gascony).

### Step 2: Goals and Planning

- **Primary Goal**: Defend our key supply centers, especially PAR (Paris).
- **Secondary Goal**: Regain control of BRE (Brest) if possible.
- **Challenges**:
  - Germany may have strong defenses with potential support from adjacent units.
  - Attacking without sufficient support could leave us vulnerable to counterattacks.

### Step 3: Analyzing Possible Orders for Each Unit

#### **Unit A PAR (Army in Paris)**

- **Possible Orders**:
  - **Hold**: Strengthen defense of PAR.
  - **Move to BRE**: Attempt to recapture BRE.
  - **Move to BUR**: Attack German unit in BUR.
  - **Support Orders**: Support our other units.

- **Analysis**:
  - **Attacking BRE**:
    - Risky due to potential German support from A BUR and F MAO.
    - Likely insufficient support to succeed.
  - **Attacking BUR**:
    - Possible with support but risks leaving PAR undefended.
  - **Holding Position**:
    - Best option to ensure we don't lose PAR to German attack.

#### **Unit A GAS (Army in Gascony)**

- **Possible Orders**:
  - **Support A PAR**: Strengthen defense of PAR.
  - **Move to BUR or BRE**: Attack German positions.
  - **Hold or Move**: Less advantageous in current situation.

- **Analysis**:
  - **Supporting A PAR**:
    - Provides additional defense against potential German attacks.
  - **Attacking BUR or BRE**:
    - Risky and unlikely to succeed without additional support.

#### **Unit A MAR (Army in Marseille)**

- **Possible Orders**:
  - **Support A PAR**: Contribute to defending PAR.
  - **Move to BUR**: Join an attack on BUR.
  - **Hold Position**: Maintain current position.

- **Analysis**:
  - **Supporting A PAR**:
    - Maximizes defensive strength at PAR.
  - **Attacking BUR**:
    - Unlikely to succeed without sufficient support.
    - Could leave MAR vulnerable.

### Step 4: Decision on Orders

After analyzing our options, the safest and most strategic choice is to focus on defending PAR:

- **A PAR H**: Hold position in Paris.
- **A GAS S A PAR**: Support A PAR to hold.
- **A MAR S A PAR**: Support A PAR to hold.

This maximizes our defensive strength at PAR, ensuring we can repel any German attack with up to a strength of 3.

### Step 5: Verification of Orders

- **Compliance with Rules**:
  - All units are issuing valid orders.
  - Support orders are to adjacent units and valid targets.
- **Strategic Justification**:
  - Orders prioritize the defense of our crucial supply center.
  - Avoids unnecessary risks with low probability of success.
- **Potential Enemy Moves Considered**:
  - Anticipated German attacks on PAR.
  - Possibility of German support for their units.

### Final Plan and Orders

We are confident in our defensive strategy for this turn. Here is the finalized plan:

```json
{
    "phase": "S1908M",
    "reason": "Given the current state where Germany poses an immediate threat with units adjacent to our territories, our primary goal is to defend our key supply center at PAR (Paris). Germany has units in BUR (Burgundy) and BRE (Brest), and could potentially launch attacks on PAR. To ensure we retain control of PAR, we are ordering all our units to support PAR holding. Attacking BUR or BRE is risky due to the possibility of German counterattacks and insufficient support. Therefore, we prioritize defense this turn while we consider future opportunities for offense.",

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'ALB': ['ADR', 'GRE', 'ION', 'SER', 'TRI']}, {'SER': ['ALB', 'BUD', 'BUL', 'GRE', 'RUM', 'TRI']}, {'TRI': ['ADR', 'ALB', 'BUD', 'SER', 'TYR', 'VEN', 'VIE']}, {'TYS': ['ION', 'LYO', 'ROM', 'NAP', 'TUN', 'TUS', 'WES']}, {'ARM': ['ANK', 'BLA', 'SEV', 'smy', 'syr']}, {'BLA': ['ANK', 'ARM', 'BUL/EC', 'CON', 'RUM', 'SEV']}, {'CON': ['AEG', 'BUL/EC', 'BUL/SC', 'BLA', 'ANK', 'SMY']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let me analyze the game state and develop a strategic plan step by step.

## Strategic Analysis

### Current State
- ITALY controls: NAP, VEN, TRI, SER (4 supply centers)
- TURKEY controls: ANK, CON, MOS (3 supply centers)
- Current units:
  - ITALY: F ALB, F TYS, A SER, A TRI
  - TURKEY: A ARM, F BLA, F CON

### Strategic Goals
1. Expand territory and supply centers
2. Weaken nearby opponents (Austria and Russia seem vulnerable)
3. Establish strategic positioning

### Potential Moves

#### Italy
- F ALB (Adriatic Fleet) can support movement or potentially move to ION
- A SER (Army Serbia) is in a good position to support attacks or move
- A TRI (Army Trieste) could potentially move towards Vienna or Budapest
- F TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea Fleet) could support Mediterranean operations

#### Turkey
- A ARM could potentially move to SEV or RUM
- F BLA could support Black Sea operations
- F CON could move to strategic positions

### Detailed Strategic Reasoning
1. The Black Sea and Balkan region seems like a key area of potential expansion
2. We can potentially collaborate to weaken Austria and Russia
3. Mediterranean control is crucial for long-term strategy

## Proposed Strategy

### Italy's Moves
1. F ALB will move to ION (strategic Mediterranean positioning)
2. A SER will support potential attack on Budapest
3. A TRI will attempt to move to VIE (Vienna)
4. F TYS will support Mediterranean operations

### Turkey's Moves
1. A ARM will move to SEV (attacking Russian territory)
2. F BLA will support ARM's move to SEV
3. F CON will move to AEG (expanding Mediterranean influence)

## Verification and Reasoning

### Attack Analysis
- VIE attack: Requires support from Serbia
- SEV attack: Supported by Black Sea fleet
- No attacks targeting our own territories
- Sufficient support for planned moves

### Final Strategic Reasoning
Our joint strategy aims to:
- Destabilize Austria and Russia
- Expand Mediterranean and Black Sea control
- Create opportunities for future territorial gains

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

There are no neutral powers in this game.

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'GAL': ['BOH', 'BUD', 'RUM', 'SIL', 'UKR', 'VIE', 'WAR']}, {'RUM': ['BLA', 'BUD', 'BUL/EC', 'GAL', 'SER', 'SEV', 'UKR']}, {'SEV': ['ARM', 'BLA', 'MOS', 'RUM', 'UKR']}, {'SWE': ['BAL', 'BOT', 'DEN', 'FIN', 'NWY', 'SKA']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Given the current situation as Russia in 'S1908M', here are the strategic considerations and orders for my units:

### Strategic Reasoning:
1. **Position and Strength Analysis**:
   - As Russia, I control a diverse spread including key areas in the East and North. My units occupy BUL, GAL, RUM, SEV, and SWE, while my supply centers include WAR, SWE, SEV, BUL, RUM.
   - Germany has grown powerful, controlling numerous centers across the map. My position relative to Germany and Turkey is precarious as they border many of my territories.

2. **Objective**:
   - Strengthen my hold in the Balkans (BUL, RUM) and defend them against potential incursions from Turkey.
   - Secure and expand my northern front, using SWE and SEV as naval bases to exert pressure and defend against German and Turkish fleets.
   - Position my units strategically to both defend my borders and prepare for offensive moves to increase my supply center count.

3. **Immediate Tactical Goals**:
   - Defend SEV from potential attacks from BLA.
   - Utilize my fleets in SEV and SWE to disrupt enemy maneuvers in adjacent seas.
   - Coordinate my units in GAL and BUL to fortify positions while preparing for a potential push into neighboring territories depending on enemy movements.

### Orders:

### Explanation of Orders:
1. **Bulgaria (A BUL)**: Holds position but supports RUM against potential attacks and helps fortify our position against Turkey.
2. **Galicia (A GAL)**: Supports A BUL to RUM, ensuring our hold on RUM is solid and potentially supporting actions into adjacent territories.
3. **Rumania (A RUM)**: Holds and supports BUL, reciprocating the support to maintain defensive strength against Turkey.
4. **Sevastopol (F SEV)**: Supports A RUM to BUL which could potentially assist in an offensive action into Turkish territory (BUL) if the situation allows.
5. **Sweden (F SWE)**: Supports fleet actions in BOT to BAL, reinforcing our naval position in the north and preparing for potential engagements with German fleets.

These strategic moves aim to solidify my position defensively while setting the stage for offensive moves dependent on the outcome of this turn and the actions of other players.

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

### **Your Objective:**

Your ultimate goal is absolute domination—seize every supply center and crush your opposition to win! Build and expand relentlessly, taking control of regions by launching bold, decisive attacks, control as many supply center as you can. Strike hard, strike fast, and let nothing stand in your way. Victory belongs to the bold—go conquer it!

input tokens used in this call:  11907
output tokens used in this call:  1074
Let's analyze the current situation step-by-step and prepare our strategy:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### 1. Current State Recap:
- **Austria:**
  - Units: A BUD, A GRE, F ION, A VIE
  - Supply Centers: BUD, VIE, SMY, GRE
  - Controlled Regions: BUD, EAS, SMY, GRE, ION

- **England:**
  - Units: A WAL, F MAO, F ENG
  - Supply Centers: LON, POR, LVP
  - Controlled Regions: IRI, LON, YOR, SPA, LVP, POR, WAL, MAO, ENG

#### 2. Strategic Goals:
- **Austria:**
  - Immediate threats may come from neighboring Italy and Russia.
  - Expansion opportunities: SER, which is adjacent and controlled by Italy.

- **England:**
  - Maintain control over the English Channel and MAO for sea supremacy.
  - Expansion opportunities: BEL or BRE from Germany's control.

#### 3. Possible Orders Analysis:
- **Austria:**
  - **A BUD**: Can move to RUM or support other adjacent regions.
  - **A GRE**: Can move to SER or hold.
  - **F ION**: Has numerous convoy options and can support adjacent regions.
  - **A VIE**: Can move to TRI or support adjacent regions.

- **England:**
  - **F ENG**: Can move to LON or support operations in the North Sea.
  - **F MAO**: Can move to adjacent sea zones or support operations.
  - **A WAL**: Can move to adjacent regions or support actions in LON.

### Orders and Strategy:

Based on this analysis, we can draft a potential strategy for both Austria and England:

  }
}
```

### Reasoning:
- **Austria**: Attempt to take control of RUM and SER, weakening Russian and Italian positions.
- **England**: Focus on reinforcing positions around the Channel and expanding into BRE, a key supply center currently under German control.

### Verification:
- All moves respect adjacency rules.
- Planned attacks target external powers' regions.
- Support is allocated to ensure successful attacks on contested regions.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let me think through this step-by-step:

0. Negotiation Recap:
   - No specific negotiation notes were provided in the initial state.

1. Current State Analysis:
   For ITALY:
   - Supply Centers: NAP, VEN, TRI, SER (4 total)
   - Units: 
     * A SER in Serbia
     * F ALB in Albania 
     * F TYS in Tyrrhenian Sea
     * A TRI in Trieste
   - Bordering regions include: ADR, GRE, ION, TRI, BUD, BUL, RUM, VEN

   Geopolitical Context:
   - Positioned in a strategic area between Austria, Turkey, and the Balkans
   - Potential opportunities to expand into Greece, Austria, or Romania

2. Strategic Goals:
   - Expand control in the Balkan region
   - Potentially challenge Austria or Turkey
   - Secure more supply centers

3. Unit Analysis:
   A SER (Serbia):
   - Potential moves: 
     * Move to Trieste (attacking Austria)
     * Move to Rumania 
     * Move to Bulgaria
     * Support other units

   F ALB (Albania):
   - Potential moves:
     * Move to Greece
     * Support movement to Greece
     * Hold position

   A TRI (Trieste):
   - Potential moves:
     * Move to Vienna
     * Move to Budapest
     * Support other units

   F TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea):
   - Potential moves:
     * Convoy units
     * Move to Ionian Sea
     * Support movements

4. Detailed Order Considerations:
   - A SER could support A TRI moving to Vienna
   - F ALB could support movement to Greece
   - A TRI could attempt to move to Vienna with support
   - F TYS could provide convoy support

5. Verification of Strategic Moves:
   - Ensure attacks have sufficient support
   - Avoid moving into own controlled regions
   - Maximize potential for supply center acquisition

Based on this analysis, here's a proposed strategy:

{
    "phase": "F1908M",
    "reason": "Strategic push to destabilize Austria and potentially gain territory in the Balkans",
    "my_location": ["NAP", "VEN", "TRI", "SER"],
    "my_unit": ["SER", "ALB", "TYS", "TRI"],
    "adjacent": [
        {"SER": ["ALB", "BUD", "BUL", "GRE", "RUM", "TRI"]},
        {"ALB": ["ADR", "GRE", "ION", "SER", "TRI"]},
        {"TRI": ["ADR", "ALB", "BUD", "SER", "TYR", "VEN", "VIE"]},
        {"TYS": ["ION", "LYO", "ROM", "NAP", "TUN", "TUS", "WES"]}
    ],
    "other_power_location": ["VIE", "BUD", "GRE"],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 0, 0, 0],
    "attackable": ["VIE", "BUD", "GRE"],
    "attack_analysis": [
        {"VIE": 2},
        {"BUD": 2},
        {"GRE": 1}
    ],
    "support_given": [
        {"supporter": "SER", "supported": "TRI", "target": "VIE"},
        {"supporter": "ALB", "supported": "TRI", "target": "VIE"}
    ],
    "attack_mask": {
        "AUSTRIA": [1, 1, 0, 0],
        "TURKEY": [0, 0, 0, 0]
    },
    "orders": {
        "ITALY": [
            "A TRI - VIE",
            "A SER S A TRI - VIE",
            "F ALB S A TRI - VIE",
            "F TYS H"
        ]
    }
}

The strategy focuses on:
1. Attacking Vienna with multiple supports
2. Using Serbia and Albania to support the attack
3. Holding Tyrrhenian Sea for strategic flexibility
4. Potentially destabilizing Austria's position

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the strategy?

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",

     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

In the south, we attempt to break into Trieste from Venice with support from Tyrol against Italy. Meanwhile, our fleet in NAO strikes at Liverpool, which is unoccupied, to gain another English supply center. We also probe Sweden from the Baltic Sea, though we lack immediate support for it.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

As Russia in the game of Diplomacy during the F1908M phase, having key units positioned in Bulgaria (BUL), Galicia (GAL), Rumania (RUM), and Sweden (SWE) offers a variety of strategic opportunities. The current geopolitical landscape and adjacent regions for these units are essential to developing an effective strategy for this phase. Here is an analysis and proposed plan based on the given scenario:

### Strategic Reasoning:

1. **Objective Analysis**: Russia controls key supply centers and has a strong presence in eastern Europe. The goal is to bolster defenses while also considering opportunities to expand influence, particularly focusing on gaining more supply centers necessary for building additional units.

2. **Threats and Opportunities**:
   - **Turkey** poses a direct threat from the south with units in Black Sea (BLA) and other adjacent territories.
   - **Germany** has a powerful presence in central Europe which can be concerning but also offers a potential ally against other strong powers.
   - Potential expansion into northern Europe (Scandinavia) using Sweden.

3. **Current Unit Positions and Movements**:
   - **BUL**: Positioned effectively against Turkey, a critical juncture for both defense and offensive operations.
   - **GAL**: Central to operations against Austria and potential to support moves in Ukraine or Rumania.
   - **RUM**: Vital for defending against the southern flank, especially from Turkish aggressions.
   - **SWE**: Offers naval opportunities in the Baltic and potential land movements towards Scandinavia.

### Proposed Orders and Rationale:

Here's the considered approach for each unit:

1. **Army Bulgaria (A BUL)**:
   - **Order**: A BUL - CON
   - **Rationale**: Move to Constantinople to pressure Turkish defenses, leveraging a direct approach to weaken Turkey’s hold and potentially capture a crucial supply center.

2. **Army Galicia (A GAL)**:
   - **Order**: A GAL S A RUM - BUD
   - **Rationale**: Support move from Rumania to Budapest to expand influence into Austria, exploiting the vulnerabilities created by potential conflicts with other powers.

3. **Army Rumania (A RUM)**:
   - **Order**: A RUM - BUD
   - **Rationale**: Move into Budapest if Turkish forces appear weakened or distracted, aiming for territorial expansion and weakening Austria’s position.

4. **Fleet Sweden (F SWE)**:
   - **Order**: F SWE - DEN
   - **Rationale**: Move to Denmark to extend naval reach and prepare for further operations either into Germany’s maritime zones or toward Norway, expanding control over additional supply centers in Scandinavia.

### JSON Output for Orders:

    "attack_mask": {
        "TURKEY": [1, 0],
        "AUSTRIA": [1, 1],
        "GERMANY": [1]
    },
    "orders": {
        "RUSSIA": ["A BUL - CON", "A GAL S A RUM - BUD", "A RUM - BUD", "F SWE - DEN"]
    }
}
```

This strategy focuses on maximizing territorial gains while being prepared to defend against counter-moves from rival powers. The use of support, offensive movements, and strategic positioning should ideally place Russia in a stronger position by the end of this phase.

"reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
"orders": {
    "FRANCE": ["F BRE B", "A PAR B", ...],

}

Where "orders" is a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of each location's decision. For each location, you can only issue one order. The length of the list of each power should match the number of locations for which you can issue orders.

The string should be able to be parsed to json str. So don't use special characters like \n, \t, etc. Generate the text with standard straight double quotes. Do not add comments inside the output! 
The possible orders you can issue are as follows:
{'FRANCE': {}}
Remember, you need to reach the configured number of supply centers (build more and more supply centers) to win.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

Let's break this down step by step following your instructions:

### Step 0: Recap Negotiations
- Since no details of the negotiation phase are provided, I will focus on the current strategic map and unit positions.

### Step 1: Current State Analysis
- **Austria:**
  - Units: A GRE, F ION, A VIE
  - Supply Centers: VIE, SMY, GRE
  - Controlled Influence: EAS, SMY, GRE, ION
- **England:**
  - Units: A WAL, F MAO
  - Supply Centers: LON, POR
  - Controlled Influence: IRI, LON, YOR, POR, WAL, MAO, ENG
- **Observations on Other Powers:**
  - Germany holds significant territories including multiple supply centers.
  - No retreat orders needed across all players, indicating a relatively stable board.

### Step 2: Strategic Goal
- The objective is to control more supply centers.
- Target regions for potential expansion: SER (adjacent to GRE), BRE (adjacent to MAO), ALB (adjacent to ION), TRI (adjacent to VIE).

### Step 3: Possible Orders Analysis
**Austria:**
- **A GRE:**
  - Possible to move to SER, which is a supply center controlled by Italy.
- **F ION:**
  - Can support movements to ALB or move directly.
- **A VIE:**
  - Can move to TRI, which is a supply center controlled by Germany.

**England:**
- **A WAL:**
  - Can move to LVP or YOR, but neither are strategic targets.
- **F MAO:**
  - Could be used to support actions or move towards BRE.

### Step 4: Decision Making
- **A GRE** should attempt to move to SER to capture a supply center.
- **F ION** will support this attack by providing convoy or support into ALB, preparing for future rounds.
- **A VIE** should move to TRI to regain control over the home center.
- **A WAL** will hold its position since WAL isn’t strategically advantageous for movement.
- **F MAO** will attempt to move to BRE to disrupt German influence.

### Step 5: Verification
- Ensure attack targets are not currently controlled by me.
- Austria's attack on SER will be supported indirectly by F ION's defensive stance.
- England’s F MAO move to BRE is directly attacking and attempting to gain control.
  
Now, let's construct the JSON response based on the above analysis:

```json

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",

     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let me analyze the game state and develop a strategic plan step by step.

## Strategic Analysis

0. Negotiation Phase Context:
   - No specific previous negotiation details were provided
   - Focus will be on strategic territorial expansion

1. Current State Analysis:
   - ITALY Units:
     * A SER (Serbia)
     * F ALB (Albania)
     * F TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea)

   - ITALY Supply Centers: 
     * NAP, VEN, SER (3 total)

   - Strategic Position:
     * Centrally located in Balkans
     * Potential for expansion into Balkans and Mediterranean
     * Limited naval and land unit count

2. Expansion Strategy:
   - Immediate Targets:
     * Greece (potential weak point)
     * Romania/Bulgaria region
     * Adriatic Sea area

3. Unit Analysis and Possible Moves:

   For A SER (Serbia):
   - Can move to: TRI, RUM, BUD, BUL, GRE
   - Most promising targets: TRI (Austria), RUM (potential Russian conflict)

   For F ALB (Albania):
   - Can move to: GRE, ION, TRI, ADR
   - Best strategic move: Support movement into Greece or ION

   For F TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea):
   - Can move to: ROM, NAP, ION, LYO, WES
   - Potential convoy operations

4. Specific Strategic Considerations:
   - Need to create opportunities for expansion
   - Minimize risk of counterattacks
   - Potentially collaborate with other powers against stronger opponents

## Detailed Order Planning

After careful analysis, here's a strategic JSON plan:

{
    "phase": "S1909M",
    "reason": "Expand into Balkan region, target weak Austrian and Russian positions, create naval mobility",
    "my_location": ["SER", "ALB", "TYS"],
    "my_unit": ["A SER", "F ALB", "F TYS"],
    "adjacent": [
        {"SER": ["ALB", "BUD", "BUL", "GRE", "RUM", "TRI"]},
        {"ALB": ["ADR", "GRE", "ION", "SER", "TRI"]},
        {"TYS": ["ION", "LYO", "ROM", "NAP", "TUN", "WES"]}
    ],
    "other_power_location": ["GRE", "VIE", "RUM"],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 0, 0],
    "attackable": ["GRE", "TRI", "RUM"],
    "attack_analysis": [
        {"GRE": 2},
        {"TRI": 2},
        {"RUM": 1}
    ],
    "support_given": [
        {"supporter": "ALB", "supported": "SER", "target": "GRE"},
        {"supporter": "TYS", "supported": "SER", "target": "RUM"}
    ],
    "attack_mask": {
        "ITALY": [1, 1, 0]
    },
    "orders": {
        "ITALY": [
            "A SER - GRE",
            "F ALB S A SER - GRE",
            "F TYS S A SER - RUM"
        ]
    }
}

Key Strategic Rationale:
1. Attack Greece with supported movement
2. Use Albania fleet to support Serbia's move
3. Use Tyrrhenian Sea fleet to support potential Romania attack
4. Create pressure on Austrian and Russian borders
5. Potentially open paths for future expansion

The orders aim to:
- Capture Greece
- Potentially threaten Romania
- Maintain strategic positioning
- Minimize defensive vulnerabilities

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the strategy or explain the reasoning behind the specific orders?

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'BUD': ['GAL', 'RUM', 'SER', 'TRI', 'VIE']}, {'DEN': ['BAL', 'HEL', 'KIE', 'NTH', 'SKA', 'SWE']}, {'GAL': ['BOH', 'BUD', 'RUM', 'SIL', 'UKR', 'VIE', 'WAR']}, {'WAR': ['GAL', 'LVN', 'MOS', 'PRU', 'SIL', 'UKR']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Given the complex scenario of the Diplomacy game, let's break down strategic analysis and orders for Russia (your power) for the S1909M phase. Below, I'll analyze the potential moves, supports, and threats based on the available data, unit positions, and strategic positioning of opposing forces.

1. **Analyzing Current Positions and Strategic Goals:**

   - **BUD (Budapest):** Situated amidst several strategic points, surrounded by friendly units in GAL and SER, making it a central point for staging attacks or providing supports.

   - **GAL (Galicia):** Borders Ukrainian territories and is well-positioned to either move to dislodge enemy units in RUM (if any) or support adjacent units for a northern push or safeguarding efforts.

   - **WAR (Warsaw):** Offers routes towards the north (Baltic regions) and the east (Ukraine and Moscow). This can be a jump point for further Russian expansion or a defensive stance against potential threats from the west.

   - **DEN (Denmark):** A critical holding to maintain influence in the Baltic and control the gateways to both North Sea & Baltic Sea. The strategic priority might be maintaining its position and supporting naval actions in neighboring seas.

2. **Strategic Objective:**
   - Bolster the defense of existing territories while setting the stage for a possible offensive into regions with vulnerable enemy supply centers, particularly focusing on maintaining and expanding influence in the Balkans and central Europe.

3. **Orders and Reasoning:**

### Potential Orders:

- **Budapest:**
  - **Hold:** A BUD H (Given the central location and surrounded by friendly units, holding is a safe option to maintain the status quo and preparing for a potential springboard in the future.)
  - **Support:** A BUD S A BUL - RUM (Support an attack to take over Romania if applicable, increasing influence in the Balkans.)

- **Galicia:**
  - **Move:** A GAL - RUM (Offensive move towards Romania to push enemy lines back and gain a strategic foothold.)
  - **Hold:** A GAL H (Hold position as a defensive stance if there's significant threat from the neighboring units.)

- **Warsaw:**
  - **Move:** A WAR - PRU (Push towards Prussia to open up another front against German forces, considering they have multiple fronts open.)
  - **Hold:** A WAR H (Defensive hold to prevent any potential back-stab from neighboring forces.)

- **Denmark:**
  - **Support:** F DEN S F SWE - BAL (Support Swedish fleet into Baltic Sea for increased naval dominance and pressure on German naval units.)
  - **Hold:** F DEN H (Maintain control of Danish straits and ensure control over movement between Baltic and North Seas.)

### JSON Format for Orders:

```json
{
    "phase": "S1909M",
    "reason": "The focus is on consolidating Russian strength in Eastern and Central Europe while initiating a gradual push into strategically vulnerable enemy territories such as Romania and Prussia. Denmark will serve as a naval support point to exert control in the Baltic Sea.",

    "attackable": ["RUM", "PRU"],
    "attack_analysis": [{"RUM": 2}, {"PRU": 2}],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUD", "supported": "BUL", "target": "RUM"}, {"supporter": "DEN", "supported": "SWE", "target": "BAL"}],
    "attack_mask": {
        "TURKEY": [0, 1],
        "GERMANY": [0, 1]
    },
    "orders": {
        "RUSSIA": ["A BUD H", "A GAL - RUM", "A WAR - PRU", "F DEN S F SWE - BAL"]
    }
}
```

This approach balances between offensive initiatives and defensive postures, ensuring Russia's expansion and security in the contested regions.

[{'GAL': ['BOH', 'BUD', 'RUM', 'SIL', 'UKR', 'VIE', 'WAR']}, {'ION': ['ADR', 'AEG', 'ALB', 'APU', 'EAS', 'GRE', 'NAP', 'TUN', 'TYS']}, {'MAO': ['BRE', 'ENG', 'GAS', 'IRI', 'NAF', 'NAO', 'POR', 'SPA/NC', 'SPA/SC', 'WES']}, {'WAL': ['ENG', 'IRI', 'LON', 'LVP', 'yor']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let's analyze the game state and your potential moves step by step.

### Step 0: Recap of Negotiation
Since no specific notes are provided for this state, we will focus on the current game setup.

### Step 1: Current State Analysis
- **AUSTRIA**
  - Units: 
    - F ION
    - A GAL
  - Supply Centers: VIE, SMY, GRE
  - Regions Controlled: EAS, SMY, ION, GAL

- **ENGLAND**
  - Units: 
    - A WAL
    - F MAO
  - Supply Centers: LON, POR
  - Regions Controlled: LON, YOR, POR, WAL, MAO, ENG

- **Other Powers**
  - GERMANY is strong with many units and supply centers, potentially threatening.
  - RUSSIA and TURKEY are in Eastern Europe and the Black Sea region, which may influence Austrian moves.

### Step 2: Supply Center Control Strategy
- For **AUSTRIA**, focus on securing a stronger position in Eastern Europe or the Mediterranean.
- For **ENGLAND**, maintain control in the British Isles and extend influence into Western Europe or the Atlantic.
  
### Step 3: Possible Orders Analysis

#### AUSTRIA:

1. **F ION:**
   - Consider moving to a territory that provides strategic advantage or might be easier to capture, such as TUN or ADR.

2. **A GAL:**
   - Moving to WAR or UKR could contest Russian influence. Alternatively, consider defensive support.

#### ENGLAND:

1. **F MAO:**
   - Moving to ENG or SPA/SC could be strategic for positioning and influence in Western Europe.

2. **A WAL:**
   - Consider moving to LVP or supporting actions in the British Isles or Northern Europe.

### Step 4: Decision and Verification
- Ensure all moves target regions controlled by other powers or enhance strategic positioning.
- Provide enough support where necessary to outmaneuver other units.

### Step 5: Verification Against Rules
- All moves are adjacent as required.
- Attack targets are not my own controlled regions.

     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>
{'FRANCE': {'GAS': ['A GAS S A BRE', 'A GAS - PAR', 'A GAS H', 'A GAS S A BRE - SPA', 'A GAS - SPA', 'A GAS - WAL VIA', 'A GAS S A PAR', 'A GAS S A WAL - BRE', 'A GAS - SPA VIA', 'A GAS S A BRE - PAR', 'A GAS S A MAR - BUR', 'A GAS - POR VIA', 'A GAS S F MAO - SPA/SC', 'A GAS - BRE', 'A GAS S F MAO - BRE', 'A GAS S A PAR - BRE', 'A GAS - MAR', 'A GAS S A PIC - BUR', 'A GAS S A PIC - BRE', 'A GAS - NAF VIA', 'A GAS - BUR', 'A GAS S A RUH - BUR', 'A GAS S A MAR - SPA', 'A GAS S A PAR - BUR', 'A GAS S A PIC - PAR', 'A GAS S A WAL - SPA', 'A GAS S F MAO - SPA/NC', 'A GAS - BRE VIA', 'A GAS - LVP VIA', 'A GAS S F MAO - SPA', 'A GAS S A MAR'], 'MAR': ['A MAR S A PAR - BUR', 'A MAR S A WAL - GAS', 'A MAR S A TYR - PIE', 'A MAR S A WAL - SPA', 'A MAR S A BRE - GAS', 'A MAR S F MAO - SPA/SC', 'A MAR S A GAS', 'A MAR - SPA', 'A MAR - GAS', 'A MAR S F MAO - SPA/NC', 'A MAR S A PIC - BUR', 'A MAR S A PAR - GAS', 'A MAR S F MAO - GAS', 'A MAR S A BRE - SPA', 'A MAR - BUR', 'A MAR S A RUH - BUR', 'A MAR S A GAS - BUR', 'A MAR S F MAO - SPA', 'A MAR H', 'A MAR - PIE', 'A MAR S A GAS - SPA']}}
</possible_orders>

### **Your Objective:**

Your ultimate goal is absolute domination—seize every supply center and crush your opposition to win! Build and expand relentlessly, taking control of regions by launching bold, decisive attacks, control as many supply center as you can. Strike hard, strike fast, and let nothing stand in your way.

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'ALB': ['ADR', 'GRE', 'ION', 'SER', 'TRI']}, {'GRE': ['AEG', 'ALB', 'BUL/SC', 'ION', 'SER']}, {'TYS': ['ION', 'LYO', 'ROM', 'NAP', 'TUN', 'TUS', 'WES']}, {'ANK': ['ARM', 'BLA', 'CON', 'smy']}, {'BLA': ['ANK', 'ARM', 'BUL/EC', 'CON', 'RUM', 'SEV']}, {'CON': ['AEG', 'BUL/EC', 'BUL/SC', 'BLA', 'ANK', 'SMY']}, {'SEV': ['ARM', 'BLA', 'MOS', 'RUM', 'UKR']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current State Analysis:
   - As ITALY and TURKEY, we currently control:
     * ITALY: ALB, GRE, TYS (3 supply centers)
     * TURKEY: ANK, BLA, CON, SEV (4 supply centers)
   - Key strategic observations:
     * We have a good position in the Balkans and Eastern Mediterranean
     * Potential opportunities to expand towards Greece, Romania, and Italy's mainland

2. Strategic Goal:
   - Expand controlled supply centers
   - Weaken neighboring powers, especially AUSTRIA and RUSSIA
   - Create strategic depth and potential for future conquests

3. Unit Analysis and Potential Moves:

For ITALY:
   - F ALB: Potential moves to ION, GRE, or support other units
   - A GRE: Potential moves to SER, BUL, or convoy opportunities
   - F TYS: Potential moves to NAP, ROM, or support naval operations

For TURKEY:
   - F ANK: Can move to BLA, ARM, or CON
   - F BLA: Multiple convoy and movement options
   - F CON: Can move to AEG, BLA, or support other units
   - A SEV: Can move to RUM, ARM, or MOS

4. Strategic Considerations:
   - We want to create pressure on RUSSIA's southern regions
   - Potential convoy of A SEV to RUM or ARM
   - Support movements that destabilize AUSTRIA or RUSSIA

5. Proposed Strategy:

For ITALY:
   - F ALB will support A GRE moving to SER
   - A GRE will move to SER
   - F TYS will support potential convoy or move to protect our interests

For TURKEY:
   - F ANK supports F BLA moving to CON
   - F BLA moves to CON
   - A SEV prepares to move to RUM

6. Detailed Analysis Verification:
   - Checked adjacent regions ✓
   - Verified no moves into own regions ✓
   - Ensured potential support for moves ✓

        ]
    }
}
```

This strategy aims to:
1. Expand into SER for ITALY
2. Move towards CON for TURKEY
3. Prepare potential future moves into RUM
4. Maintain defensive positions
5. Create pressure on neighboring powers

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the strategy?

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'BUD': ['GAL', 'RUM', 'SER', 'TRI', 'VIE']}, {'PRU': ['BAL', 'BER', 'LVN', 'SIL', 'WAR']}, {'RUM': ['BLA', 'BUD', 'BUL/EC', 'GAL', 'SER', 'SEV', 'UKR']}, {'SKA': ['DEN', 'NWY', 'NTH', 'SWE']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Given the fantastic detail provided in the setup, let's evaluate Russia's strategic position and draft orders based on current standings and considerations. This strategic process will involve analyzing the surrounding environment, potential threats, and opportunities for expansion.

### Recap, Current Control and Analysis
Russia controls:
- **Supply Centers**: Warsaw, Bulgaria, Romania, Budapest, Denmark
- **Units**: Army in Bulgaria (A BUL), Army in Budapest (A BUD), Army in Romania (A RUM), Army in Prussia (A PRU), Fleet in Skagerrak (F SKA)

### Strategy and Possible Moves:
1. **Defending Key Areas**: Focus on defending crucial areas such as Bulgaria and Romania which are close to Turkey and could be targets for expansion.

2. **Expanding Influence**: Look to expand influence into non-controlled but reachable territories, especially those that are supply centers or can provide strategic advantages.

3. **Forming Alliances**: Temporarily forming alliances can be beneficial, but with Germany's expansive presence, it may be necessary to counteract their growth.

4. **Detailed Orders Plan**:
   - **Budapest (A BUD)**: With armies in nearby regions, Budapest can play a critical role either in supporting adjacent territories or defending against attacks.
   - **Bulgaria (A BUL)**: Should continue to secure the area and potentially support movements into strategic territories such as Greece or Serbia if not currently held by an ally.
   - **Romania (A RUM)**: Central to Eastern Europe, Romania could support attacks or holds in Bulgaria or Ukraine, depending on threats.
   - **Prussia (A PRU)**: Located near Germany, Prussia can either fortify its position or support offensive moves into German territory if needed.
   - **Skagerrak (F SKA)**: This fleet can support movements into Denmark or Norway, potentially pressuring England or defending against northern movements.

### Example Orders:
- **A BUD** to hold, providing stability and potential support to surrounding regions.
- **A BUL** to support **A RUM** or to move to Greece if it's not under a strong hold, to increase supply centers.
- **A RUM** might support **A BUL** or potentially move into Ukraine if there is an opportunity.
- **A PRU** can hold, anticipating potential conflict from Germany.
- **F SKA** might support a move into Norway or Denmark, countering England's influence.

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
[{'ION': ['ADR', 'AEG', 'ALB', 'APU', 'EAS', 'GRE', 'NAP', 'TUN', 'TYS']}, {'VIE': ['BOH', 'BUD', 'GAL', 'TRI', 'TYR']}, {'WAR': ['GAL', 'LVN', 'MOS', 'PRU', 'SIL', 'UKR']}, {'LON': ['ENG', 'NTH', 'YOR', 'WAL']}, {'LVP': ['CLY', 'edi', 'IRI', 'NAO', 'WAL', 'yor']}]
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let's break down the situation step by step and determine the best orders to issue for the current state of the game.

### Step-by-step Analysis

0. **Recall Negotiations:**
   - Recall previous negotiations and assess alliances, threats, or promises. Unfortunately, no negotiation details are provided, so we proceed without this information.

1. **Current State Analysis:**

   - **Austria Control:**
     - Units: F ION, A WAR, A VIE
     - Supply Centers: VIE, SMY, GRE, WAR

   - **England Control:**
     - Units: A LVP, F SPA/SC, F LON
     - Supply Centers: LON, POR, SPA, LVP

   - **Other Powers:**
     - Germany is a dominant player with numerous units and supply centers.
     - Russia and Turkey have some units threatening regions near Austria.

2. **Goals and Planning:**

   - For Austria:
     - Consider securing sea dominance in the ION and perhaps threatening regions like Greece and Albania.
     - Gain control in the Eastern front via WAR, possibly moving towards PRU or GAL.

   - For England:
     - Ensure control over Iberia (SPA, POR) and consider launching support operations or attacks into Western Europe or maintaining control over the North Atlantic.

3. **Possible Orders Analysis:**

   - **Austria:**
     - **F ION:** Could attack into adjacent sea areas like ADR, AEG, TYS, or support units in adjacent regions.
     - **A VIE:** Considered moves to TRI or GAL; however, more prudent to hold or support to ensure stability in the central front.
     - **A WAR:** Strategic moves could be towards PRU or holding to support against German aggression.

   - **England:**
     - **F LON:** Could move into ENG to threaten France or hold to maintain position.
     - **A LVP:** Could move into WAL for defensive positioning or project force into ENG.
     - **F SPA/SC:** Perhaps hold, or support moves into MAO or POR.

4. **Decision-Making:**

   - For Austria:
     - **F ION:** Move towards ADR to project strength into the Adriatic.
     - **A VIE:** Support GAL, a strategic position against Germany.
     - **A WAR:** Consider moving to PRU to project strength into northern territories.

   - For England:
     - **F LON:** Move to ENG, expanding influence and projecting threat.
     - **A LVP:** Move to WAL to maintain control.
     - **F SPA/SC:** Support moves or hold to consolidate strength.

5. **Verification:**

   - Ensure orders do not result in moving into controlled regions unnecessarily.
   - Validate strength in potential conflicts — ensure adequate support.

### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

Let me analyze this step by step:

0. Negotiation Phase Recap:
- I currently control ITALY and TURKEY
- Need to carefully coordinate moves between these two powers

1. Current State Analysis:
ITALY Units:
- F ALB (Albania)
- F TYS (Tyrrhenian Sea)
- A SER (Serbia)

TURKEY Units:
- F ANK (Ankara)
- F BLA (Black Sea)
- F CON (Constantinople)
- A SEV (Sevastopol)

Supply Centers:
- ITALY: NAP, VEN, SER (3 centers)
- TURKEY: ANK, CON, MOS, SEV (4 centers)

2. Strategic Goals:
- Expand supply centers
- Potential targets: Greece, Bulgaria, Trieste
- Need to coordinate ITALY and TURKEY moves

3. Unit Analysis:
ITALY Potential Actions:
- F ALB could move to Greece or support an attack
- A SER could move to Trieste or support an attack
- F TYS could support naval movements

TURKEY Potential Actions:
- F ANK could support moves to Armenia or Constantinople
- F BLA could convoy or support Black Sea region moves
- A SEV could move to Ukraine or support regional attacks
- F CON could support Balkan movements

4. Specific Strategic Considerations:
- Target: Take Greece from Austria/Russia
- Potential convoy of A SEV to support regional expansion
- Coordinate support between ITALY and TURKEY units

5. Proposed Strategy:
ITALY Moves:
- F ALB → GRE (attempt to capture Greece)
- A SER → TRI (attack Trieste)
- F TYS → ION (secure naval position)

TURKEY Moves:
- A SEV → RUM 
- F BLA → RUM (support SEV)
- F CON → BUL/SC
- F ANK → ARM

6. Verification:
- Checked adjacent regions ✓
- Confirmed attack targets are not own regions ✓
- Analyzed support requirements ✓

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>
{'RUSSIA': {'BUL': ['A BUL - ARM VIA', 'A BUL - ANK VIA', 'A BUL S F ANK - CON', 'A BUL S F ION - GRE', 'A BUL - RUM VIA', 'A BUL S A SER', 'A BUL - GRE', 'A BUL S F ALB - GRE', 'A BUL - CON', 'A BUL S A SER - RUM', 'A BUL S A RUM - SER', 'A BUL S A RUM', 'A BUL S F BLA - RUM', 'A BUL - CON VIA', 'A BUL - SEV VIA', 'A BUL S A SER - GRE', 'A BUL S A RUM - CON', 'A BUL - SER', 'A BUL S A SEV - RUM', 'A BUL S A SEV - CON', 'A BUL H', 'A BUL - RUM', 'A BUL S F BLA - CON', 'A BUL S F CON', 'A BUL S A GAL - RUM'], 'PRU': ['A PRU S A BOH - SIL', 'A PRU - BER', 'A PRU S A WAR - SIL', 'A PRU - WAR', 'A PRU S A MUN - SIL', 'A PRU S A GAL - SIL', 'A PRU S A BER - SIL', 'A PRU S A MUN - BER', 'A PRU - SIL', 'A PRU S A WAR - LVN', 'A PRU S A WAR', 'A PRU S F BAL - LVN', 'A PRU - SWE VIA', 'A PRU - KIE VIA', 'A PRU S A BER - LVN', 'A PRU S F BAL - BER', 'A PRU - LVN VIA', 'A PRU - BER VIA', 'A PRU S A DEN - LVN', 'A PRU S A BER', 'A PRU S A DEN - BER', 'A PRU S A GAL - WAR', 'A PRU H', 'A PRU - LVN', 'A PRU - DEN VIA'], 'RUM': ['A RUM S A GAL - BUD', 'A RUM - BUL', 'A RUM - ARM VIA', 'A RUM S A GAL', 'A RUM H', 'A RUM S A SEV - UKR', 'A RUM - ANK VIA', 'A RUM S A SER', 'A RUM S F CON - BUL/EC', 'A RUM S F CON - BUL', 'A RUM S A SER - BUL', 'A RUM S A WAR - GAL', 'A RUM S F CON - BUL/SC', 'A RUM S A SEV - BUL', 'A RUM - BUD', 'A RUM - SEV VIA', 'A RUM - BUL VIA', 'A RUM S F BLA - SEV', 'A RUM - CON VIA', 'A RUM S A VIE - GAL', 'A RUM - UKR', 'A RUM S A BUL', 'A RUM S A BOH - GAL', 'A RUM S A SER - BUD', 'A RUM - SER', 'A RUM - GAL', 'A RUM S A WAR - UKR', 'A RUM S A VIE - BUD', 'A RUM S A BUL - SEV', 'A RUM S F BLA - BUL', 'A RUM - SEV', 'A RUM S A SEV', 'A RUM S A GAL - UKR', 'A RUM S F BLA - BUL/EC', 'A RUM S A BUL - SER']}}

Given the complex state of the game and your current position as Russia, let's develop a strategic plan for your moves in this phase. Here is an analysis and potential order list based on the current situation:

### **1. Recap and Analysis of Your Position:**

- **Supply Centers Controlled:** BUL, RUM, and BUD.
- **Units:** 
  - **A BUL** (Bulgaria)
  - **A RUM** (Romania)
  - **A PRU** (Prussia)

### **2. Adjacent Regions to Consider for Moves or Support:**
- **Bulgaria (BUL):**
  - Land: RUM, SER, GRE
  - Sea: CON via Fleet, which you do not have in Black Sea.

- **Romania (RUM):**
  - Land: UKR, GAL, BUD, SER, BUL
  - Sea: BLA, which allows interaction with SEV, BUL/EC, CON.

- **Prussia (PRU):**
  - Land: BER, WAR, LVN, SIL
  - Sea: BAL
  
### **3. Strategic Goals and Potential Orders:**

**A. Holding and Expanding Territory:**
- Focus on maintaining control of Bulgaria, Romania, and supporting nearby regions if necessary.

**B. Possible Moves and Supports:**
- **From Bulgaria (BUL):**
  - Support action in Romania to strengthen hold on the region.
  - Possible aggressive move towards Greece (GRE) to pressure Turkey and potentially capture a supply center next year.
  - Support to Serbia (SER) if viable allies are present (check during negotiation phase).

- **From Romania (RUM):**
  - Support to Bulgaria from Romania can fortify your defensive line against Turkish or Austrian aggression.
  - Consider moving to Budapest (BUD) to reconnect with Budapest if not currently held by Austria or any other threatening force.
  - Supporting actions towards Ukraine (UKR) might be strategic if aiming to weaken Turkey further.

- **From Prussia (PRU):**
  - Support to Warsaw (WAR) to strengthen hold against potential German advancement.
  - A move towards Berlin (BER) could be considered if it appears weakly defended and could represent a strategic gain.

### **4. Specific Orders to Consider:**
- **A BUL H** (Hold position in Bulgaria)
- **A RUM S A BUL** (Support hold in Bulgaria from Romania)
- **A PRU S A WAR** (Support hold in Warsaw from Prussia)

### **5. Justification:**
- The choice to hold Bulgaria is due to its strategic positioning and the risk of losing a supply center.
- Supporting Bulgaria from Romania fortifies your hold, deterring immediate threats.
- Supporting Warsaw from Prussia can help maintain influence and deter German expansion.

### **Finalized Plan for Orders:**
```json

    },
    "orders": {
        "RUSSIA": ["A BUL H", "A RUM S A BUL", "A PRU S A WAR"]
    }
}
```

This planned set of orders focuses on maintaining current positions and defensive plays, with potential consideration for future aggressive moves based on the evolving state of the board and the outcome of the next negotiation phase.

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

Let's approach this step by step to make an informed decision for your orders.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

0. **Recap the Negotiation Phase:**
   - Review any alliances, deals, or potential threats discussed. Identify who might support or oppose your moves based on prior agreements.

1. **Analyze the Current State:**
   - **Austria:**
     - **Units:** A WAR, A VIE, F ADR
     - **Supply Centers Controlled:** VIE, SMY, GRE, WAR
     - **Adjacent Regions:** 
       - ADR is adjacent to ALB, APU, ION, TRI, VEN
       - VIE is adjacent to BOH, BUD, GAL, TRI, TYR
       - WAR is adjacent to GAL, LVN, MOS, PRU, SIL, UKR
   
   - **England:**
     - **Units:** A LVP, F SPA/SC, F LON
     - **Supply Centers Controlled:** LON, POR, SPA, LVP
     - **Adjacent Regions:** 
       - LON is adjacent to ENG, NTH, YOR, WAL
       - LVP is adjacent to CLY, EDI, IRI, NAO, WAL, YOR

   - **Other Powers:**
     - Germany has a significant presence across Europe (**15 units**), posing a strategic threat.
     - France has no units left.
     - Italy and Turkey have moderate presence.
     - Russia is relatively weak with limited units.

2. **Goal and Planning:**
   - Austria should aim to consolidate control in Eastern Europe and possibly expand into German-occupied regions.
   - England should maintain a presence in the Iberian Peninsula and consider either defending against German encroachment or expanding into less defended regions.

3. **Possible Orders Analysis:**

   **Austria:**
   
   - **WAR (A WAR) Possible Moves:**
     - Consider moving A WAR to GAL to project power east or defend VIE if necessary.
     - Consider supporting nearby units to enhance defensive or offensive capabilities.
   
   - **VIE (A VIE) Possible Moves:**
     - Moving A VIE to TRI or supporting moves against neighboring German units in BOH or TYR.
     - Consider defensive postures if the German threat is significant.
   
   - **ADR (F ADR) Possible Moves:**
     - Use F ADR to exert naval control in ION or support movements in TRI or VEN.
     - Convoy a unit from TRI if strategic naval redeployment is needed.

   **England:**
   
   - **LON (F LON) Possible Moves:**
     - Move F LON to ENG for strategic control over the English Channel.
     - Support LVP or SPA moves if German threats materialize.
   
   - **LVP (A LVP) Possible Moves:**
     - Move A LVP to WAL or YOR to support defense or position for future operations.
     - Consider supporting adjacent moves or reinforcing positions.
   
   - **SPA (F SPA/SC) Possible Moves:**
     - Move F SPA/SC to WES or MAO to assert naval control around the Iberian Peninsula.
     - Support A GAS - MAR if German control is weak there.

4. **Decision and Verification:**

   - All moves need to be verified against adjacent regions, ensuring legality of moves.
   - Support for moves should be coordinated with adjacent units and other player agreements.
   - Strategic advantage and potential future maneuvers must be analyzed.

5. **Finalize Orders:**

There are no neutral powers in this game.

The adjacent regions of your orderable regions are as follows:
<adjacent_regions>
No adjacent information provided.
</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],

    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>
{'FRANCE': {}}
</possible_orders>

### **Your Objective:**

Your ultimate goal is absolute domination—seize every supply center and crush your opposition to win! Build and expand relentlessly, taking control of regions by launching bold, decisive attacks, control as many supply center as you can. Strike hard, strike fast, and let nothing stand in your way. Victory belongs to the bold—go conquer it!

**Step-by-Step Analysis**

0. **Negotiation Phase Recap**

- There is no information provided about any negotiations, agreements, or promises from the previous phase. Therefore, I cannot factor in any diplomatic considerations at this time.

1. **Current State Analysis**

- **Supply Centers Controlled**: As France, I currently control only one supply center: Marseilles (MAR).
- **Units**: I have **no units** on the board.
- **Home Supply Centers**: My home supply centers are Brest (BRE), Paris (PAR), and Marseilles (MAR).
  - **Brest (BRE)**: Controlled by Germany and occupied by a German army (A BRE).
  - **Paris (PAR)**: Controlled by Germany.
  - **Marseilles (MAR)**: Still listed under my control but **occupied by a German army** (A MAR).
- **Builds**: I have **0 builds allowed** and no available home centers to build in, as all are either occupied or under enemy control.

**Other Powers:**

- **Germany**: Dominant on the board with numerous units and control over many regions, including my home centers Brest and Paris.
- **England, Austria, Italy, Russia, Turkey**: Have units and supply centers, but their actions are less directly impactful given my lack of units.

2. **Goals and Planning**

- **Immediate Goal**: Regain control of my home supply centers to rebuild my forces.
- **Long-Term Goal**: Reestablish a presence on the board and work towards capturing more supply centers.

However, without any units or the ability to build this turn, I cannot take any direct actions during this phase.

3. **Possible Orders for My Units**

- Since I have **no units**, there are no possible orders to consider.

4. **Decision**

- I cannot issue any orders this turn due to the absence of units and inability to build new ones.

5. **Verification**

- **Attack Targets**: Not applicable; no units to attack with.
- **Support Moves**: Not applicable; no units to give support.
- **Adjacency Checks**: Not applicable.
- **Rule Compliance**: Confirmed that with no units or builds, I cannot make any moves or orders.

**Final Plan**

- Await future opportunities to regain control of my home centers, possibly through diplomatic negotiations or changes in the game state that would allow me to rebuild.

## Think Step by Step

### 0. Recap of Previous Negotiation Phase

No notes are provided for this state, so we have no information about any agreements, promises, or threats made by other powers during the negotiation phase.

### 1. Analysis of the Current State

- **Supply Centers Controlled:**
  - We control **Marseilles (MAR)**.

- **Units:**
  - We have **no units** on the board.

- **Our Influence:**
  - Regions influenced: **Helgoland Bight (HEL)**, **Burgundy (BUR)**.

- **Other Powers:**
  - **Germany** is the dominant power, controlling many regions, including our home centers **Brest (BRE)** and **Paris (PAR)**. Germany also has an **Army in Marseilles (A MAR)**, indicating they occupy our sole supply center.
  - **England** controls nearby regions and has units in **Liverpool (A LVP)**, **London (F LON)**, and **Spain's South Coast (F SPA/SC)**.
  - **Austria**, **Italy**, **Russia**, and **Turkey** are controlling regions further from our position.

### 2. Goal Analysis

Our ultimate goal is to regain strength by controlling supply centers and rebuilding our forces. However, since we have no units and Germany occupies our only supply center, we are in a critical position.

### 3. Possible Orders for Our Units

- **Units Available:** None.
- **Possible Actions:**
  - Since we have no units, we cannot issue any orders this turn.

### 4. Order Decision

- There are **no orders** to make this turn due to the absence of units.

### 5. Verification

- **Move Targets:** Not applicable.
- **Support Orders:** Not applicable.
- **Attacks:** Not applicable.
- **Compliance with Rules:**
  - Our lack of units and builds means we cannot violate any game rules this turn.

## Final Decision

Given the current state, we cannot issue any orders. Our focus should be on future opportunities to rebuild if circumstances change.

You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round?

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>

</adjacent_regions>

First please think step by step given my instructions, do some self verification and revise on your orders:

## Think step by step

0. You should recap all the information in the previous negotiation phase, remember the agreements, promises, and threats made by each power. Analyze the outcomes of the negotiation phase and how they influence your next actions on the board.
1. Please analyze the current state of the game and your position. Which regions are you controlling? How many supply centers do you have? Where are your units? Please make detailed state analysis about you and other powers.
2. The goal of the game is to take control as many supply centers as possible. Analyze your current state, and plan how to take more supply centers later. For example, among the regions which are not your location, which location do you want to attack? You should think if you will have enough support to win each attack. You should also check all your adjcent regions and make sure you can move to them, based on <adjacent_regions> information.
3. For each of your units, analyze the possible orders. I will give you all the possible orders enclosed in <possible_orders> for each of your unit. Please consider and tell me your reasoning for each the following points: 
    3.1. Whether you should move into other regions to expand or take more supply centers? 
    3.2. Whether you should move into other power's unit to attack? 
    3.3. If you don't have enough unit to attack some region, do you want to move your other unit to the adjacent region to prepare for the attack in the next round? 
    3.4. When you choose your attack target, don't set it as your controlled region. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If you find a target as your attack target, please make sure that target is other power's location, not your own location. Moving into your unit is not considered an attack! 
    3.5. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support, and the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If you want to attack other power's unit, do you have other units support this move?
    3.6. A unit can only move to its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your move target is among its adjacent regions.
    3.7. The support unit can only support the adjacent region, and the attack target should also be its adjacent region. Please iterate over your unit's adjacent regions, and make sure that your support target is among its adjacent regions. If the unit can't support attacking the target because it's too far, you should choose another supporter or move it closer and plan to attack later.
    3.8. If you want to support unit X attacking some region, you should make sure X is actually attacking the target region. If not, it is invalid.
4. Make the order decision based on your analysis. Check your decision about whether you set a wrong attack target, move into your controlled region is not an attack!!!
5. For each intended order, please revise and verify your move target and the reason against the definitions, game rules, and your goal. For example, 
    5.1. Moving your unit into your own region is not considered an attack. You should move into other power's unit location. 
    5.2. You should take control more and more supply centers
    5.3. Ensure that your attacks are supported sufficiently to overcome any defenses.
    5.4. Iterate over your planned attack targets, and tell me whether that target is among your controlled region. If so, you should start from the beginning and think again. 
    5.5. IIterate over your planned attack targets, and compute how many other power's units are in that target location. Next, determine how many of your own units and how much support you need to succeed in the attack. You cannot attack with fewer supports than the defending unit. Verify that the total of your supports plus one is greater than the defending unit's strength. If this condition is not met, return to the beginning and think again.
    If your orders can't pass the verification, please start from the beginning and think again by the above steps.

Once you are confident, please finalize your plan, and give me a JSON object in the following format:

{
    "phase": "current_phase",
    "reason": "Your strategic reasoning here",
    "my_location": ["PAR", ...],
    "my_unit": ["BER", ...],
    "adjacent": [{"PAR": ["BUR", "GAS"]}, ...],
    "other_power_location": ["MUN", ...],
    "move_to_our_region_mask": [0, 1, ...],
    "attackable": ["MUN", ...],
    "attack_analysis": [{"MUN": 2}, ...],
    "support_given": [{"supporter": "BUR", "supported": "PAR", "target": "PIC"}, ...],
    "attack_mask": {
        "FRANCE": [1, 0, ...],
        ...
    }
    "orders": {
        "FRANCE": ["F BRE - MID", "A PAR - BUR", ...],
        ...
    }
}


### Instructions for the JSON object:

1. **Reason:**
   - Provide your strategic reasoning summary in the "reason" field.

2. **Additional Fields:**

   - **my_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have the influence or control (Please refer to the game state).
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **my_unit:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location where you have a unit.
     - Example: `["BER", ...]`

   - **adjacent:**
     - A list of dictionary.
     - Each element is a dictionary with your location as the key and a list of all the adjacent locations as the value. Please refer to <adjacent_regions>
     - Example: `[{"MUN": ["TYR", "BOH"]}, ...]`

   - **other_power_location:**
     - A list of strings.
     - Each element corresponds to a location that is other power's location.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **move_to_our_region_mask:**
     - A list of integers (0 or 1).
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list.
     - `1` indicates that the order involves moving to your influenced or controlled region. (Please refer to the game state)
     - `0` indicates that the order does not involve moving to your influenced or controlled region.
     - Example: `[0, 1, 0]`

   - **attackable:**
     - A list of locations.
     - Each location is a region that is other power's location and you can move into to attack in this turn.
     - You should NOTICE, you usually made mistakes here! The locations in my_location and my_unit should not be included in this list. You can only choose from adjacent locations.
     - Example: `["MUN", ...]`

   - **attack_analysis:**
    - A list of dictionaries.
    - Each dictionary contains key: the location string you want to attack in this round. value: the number of units anyone needs to win the attack. A unit may not move into a province held by another unit unless it has support. As units may be supported either in attacking a province or in holding a province, the attacking unit must have more support than the defending unit if the attack is to be successful. If the attack is not successful, the attacking unit does not move anywhere. I already gave you other powers' unit locations above. Only an estimate is needed here. Because you don't know whether other powers will support or not.
    - Example: `[{"MUN": 2}, {"RUH": 1} ...]`

   - **support_given:**
     - A list of dictionaries.
     - Each dictionary contains the supported unit's location and the location of the unit being supported. And the target location. (based on the order you want to issue)
     - Example: `[{"supporter": "BOH", "supported": "MUN", "target": "TYR"}, ...]`

   - **attack_mask:**
     - A dictionary of lists of integers (0 or 1). The same length as the "orders" list.
     - Each element corresponds to an order in the "orders" list. If the target is in my_location, it is not considered an attack. Attack is moving into other power's unit location.
     - `1` indicates that the order is an attack.
     - `0` indicates that the order is not an attack.
     - Example: `{"FRANCE": [1, 0, ...], ...}`

3. **Orders:**
    - The "orders" field should be a dictionary where the key is the power name and the value is a list of strings chosen from the possible orders.
    - For each location, you can only issue one order.
    - The number of orders should match the number of locations you can issue orders for.
    - Each string represents an order for a unit.
    - If possible_orders is empty for a power, just leave the "orders" field empty for that power.

4. **JSON Formatting Guidelines:**
   - Use standard straight double quotes (`"`).
   - Do not include special characters like `
`, `	`, etc.
   - Do not add comments inside the JSON output.

### **Possible Orders:**

All the possible orders that you can issue are as follows (key is the location, value is the list of possible orders at that location):

<possible_orders>
{'RUSSIA': {'BUL': ['A BUL - ARM VIA', 'A BUL - ANK VIA', 'A BUL S A TRI - GRE', 'A BUL S F ION - GRE', 'A BUL - RUM VIA', 'A BUL S A TRI - SER', 'A BUL - GRE', 'A BUL - CON', 'A BUL S A RUM - SER', 'A BUL S A RUM', 'A BUL S F BLA - RUM', 'A BUL S F GRE', 'A BUL - CON VIA', 'A BUL - SEV VIA', 'A BUL S A RUM - CON', 'A BUL - SER', 'A BUL S A SEV - RUM', 'A BUL S A SEV - CON', 'A BUL H', 'A BUL - RUM', 'A BUL S F BLA - CON', 'A BUL S F CON', 'A BUL S A GAL - RUM'], 'PRU': ['A PRU S A SIL - WAR', 'A PRU S A BOH - SIL', 'A PRU - BER', 'A PRU S A WAR - SIL', 'A PRU - WAR', 'A PRU S A MUN - SIL', 'A PRU S A GAL - SIL', 'A PRU S A BER - SIL', 'A PRU S A MUN - BER', 'A PRU - SIL', 'A PRU S A WAR - LVN', 'A PRU S A WAR', 'A PRU S F BOT - LVN', 'A PRU S A BER', 'A PRU S A SIL - BER', 'A PRU S A GAL - WAR', 'A PRU H', 'A PRU - LVN', 'A PRU S A SIL'], 'RUM': ['A RUM S A GAL - BUD', 'A RUM - BUL', 'A RUM - ARM VIA', 'A RUM S A GAL', 'A RUM H', 'A RUM S A SEV - UKR', 'A RUM S F GRE - BUL', 'A RUM - ANK VIA', 'A RUM S F CON - BUL/EC', 'A RUM S F CON - BUL', 'A RUM S A WAR - GAL', 'A RUM S F CON - BUL/SC', 'A RUM S A SEV - BUL', 'A RUM - BUD', 'A RUM S F GRE - BUL/SC', 'A RUM - SEV VIA', 'A RUM S F BLA - SEV', 'A RUM - CON VIA', 'A RUM S A VIE - GAL', 'A RUM - BUL VIA', 'A RUM - UKR', 'A RUM S A BUL', 'A RUM S A BOH - GAL', 'A RUM S A SIL - GAL', 'A RUM - SER', 'A RUM S F ARM - SEV', 'A RUM - GAL', 'A RUM S A TRI - BUD', 'A RUM S A WAR - UKR', 'A RUM S A VIE - BUD', 'A RUM S A BUL - SEV', 'A RUM S F BLA - BUL', 'A RUM - SEV', 'A RUM S A SEV', 'A RUM S A GAL - UKR', 'A RUM S F BLA - BUL/EC', 'A RUM S A BUL - SER', 'A RUM S A TRI - SER']}}

Based on the current game state and strategic considerations, here are the orders for Russia using the in-depth analysis provided:

1. **Reasoning for Orders:**
   - Russia holds three units located in BUL, PRU, and RUM. With the adjacent territories accessible, the aim is to expand influence, capture supply centers, and possibly disrupt enemy plans by supporting our units or allies effectively.
   - BUL is strategically placed to exert pressure on Turkey's SEV and CON, and to defend against movements towards BUL itself. 
   - PRU being close to Berlin (BER) and Warsaw (WAR) gives an opportunity to move aggressively into German territories or to support our unit in Warsaw if needed.
   - RUM is pivotal for eastern front stability, helping secure the surrounding regions like BUL and potentially advancing into Balkan territories.
   - Given the balance of power, defensive plays with potential opportunistic attacks might be the optimal choice.

2. **My Locations and Units:**
   - Russia holds influence over `["BUL", "RUM", "PRU", "BUD", "LVN", "MOS", "UKR", "SKA"]`.
   - Russian units are located in `["BUL", "PRU", "RUM"]`.

3. **Adjacent Regions for Reference:**
   - `{"BUL": ["BLA", "RUM", "GRE", "SER", "CON"]}`
   - `{"PRU": ["BAL", "BER", "LVN", "SIL", "WAR"]}`
   - `{"RUM": ["BLA", "BUD", "BUL/EC", "GAL", "SER", "SEV", "UKR"]}`

4. **Other Powers' Locations Include:**
   - German units and influence are significant in Europe, holding territories like `["BER", "MUN", "SIL", "WAR", "DEN"]`.

5. **Plan and Orders:**

   - **BUL:**
     - Move 'A BUL - CON': Aggressive move to capture Constantinople, leveraging Turkey's spread-out positioning.
   - **PRU:**
     - Support 'A PRU S A WAR': By supporting Warsaw, we ensure stability on the Western front against Germany.
   - **RUM:**
     - Hold 'A RUM H': Strengthening our position to repel any potential attacks from Turkey or others.
    
6. **JSON Representation for the Order:**

Based on the current game situation and considering that I am playing as Russia with control over the territories of Bulgaria (BUL), Rumania (RUM), and Prussia (PRU), here’s a strategic analysis and order plan for the Fall 1910 Movement phase:

### **Strategic Analysis:**

#### **Current Holdings and Military Position:**
- Russian control is relatively limited with three armies in Bulgaria, Rumania, and Prussia.
- Proximity to several crucial territories including those held by Turkey and Austria, which can be potential targets.

#### **Immediate Objectives:**
1. **Strengthening Borders:**
    - Secure borders against potential aggression from neighboring countries, particularly Turkey and Austria.
  
2. **Expansion into Strategic Territories:**
    - Considering an expansion into Constantinople (CON) through Bulgaria, which is a strategic supply center held by Turkey.

3. **Support and Defense:**
    - Utilize armies to support one another to both defend and potentially aid in aggressive moves, particularly focusing on breaking into Turkish and Austrian territories.

### **Planned Orders:**

#### **Overview of Possible Orders:**
- `Bulgaria (BUL)`:
  - Attack or Support into Constantinople, Greece, or Serbia.
- `Prussia (PRU)`:
  - Support moves in surrounding territories like Berlin, Silesia, or potentially move towards Warsaw.
- `Rumania (RUM)`:
  - Support moves in adjacent territories or defense.

#### **Proposed Orders:**
1. **Bulgaria (BUL):**
   - **Order:**
     - **A BUL - CON**
   - **Reasoning:**
     - Move to attack and potentially gain control over Constantinople, a strategic supply center and weaken Turkish defensive lines.

2. **Prussia (PRU):**
   - **Order:**
     - **A PRU S A BUL - CON**
   - **Reasoning:**
     - Provide support to Bulgaria's attack on Constantinople, ensuring better chances of success against Turkish defense.

3. **Rumania (RUM):**
   - **Order:**
     - **A RUM S A BUL - CON**
   - **Reasoning:**
     - Additional support for the attack on Constantinople from Bulgaria, maximizing the force applied in this strategic move.

### **Conclusion and Defensive Considerations:**
- The orders focus primarily on offensively taking Constantinople while ensuring that the forces are supported adequately to maximize the success probability.
- Defensively, attention must be kept on Austria’s actions and potential counter-moves by Turkey, especially in regions adjacent to Rumania and Bulgaria.
