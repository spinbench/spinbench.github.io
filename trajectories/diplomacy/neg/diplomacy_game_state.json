No aggressive actions planned against these powers. \n\nStep 1: Our units are positioned as follows: Fleet in Brest (F BRE), Army in Paris (A PAR), and Army in Marseilles (A MAR). We control the supply centers in Brest, Paris, and Marseilles. Our goal is to expand by capturing neutral supply centers.\n\nStep 2: Identified neutral supply centers within reach: Spain and Portugal. Plan to move toward these to increase our supply centers.\n\nStep 3: Analyzed possible orders for each unit:\n- **F BRE**: Options include moving to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean (MAO) or holding. Moving to MAO positions us to reach Portugal next turn.\n- **A MAR**: Options include moving to Spain (SPA) or holding. Moving to SPA allows us to capture the supply center there.\n- **A PAR**: Options include moving to Gascony (GAS), Picardy (PIC), or holding. Moving to GAS supports our southern operations without threatening England or Germany.\n\nStep 4: Decided on the following orders:\n- F BRE - MAO: Move fleet to Mid-Atlantic Ocean.\n- A MAR - SPA: Move army to Spain to capture the supply center.\n- A PAR - GAS: Move army to Gascony to support future actions in the south.\n\nStep 5: Verified decisions:\n- All moves are into adjacent, unoccupied regions.\n- No agreements are violated.\n- We are not moving into our own regions or attacking other powers without sufficient support.\n- Moves align with our strategic goal of expansion.",

Moving our army from Marseilles to Spain secures that supply center. Shifting our fleet from Brest to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean positions us to move into Portugal in the next turn. Moving our army from Paris to Gascony provides support for our southern operations and maintains flexibility. These moves honor our agreements with England and Germany by avoiding the English Channel and Burgundy, and they focus on growth without provoking conflicts.",

In the previous negotiation phase, we agreed with England to cooperate against Germany by moving into Burgundy, despite telling Germany we would not. We maintained peaceful relations with Italy to secure our southern border.\n1. Currently, we control the regions BRE, MAR, PAR, MAO, SPA, and GAS. Our units are located in GAS (A GAS), SPA (A SPA), and MAO (F MAO). Germany has units near us, specifically A RUH adjacent to Burgundy. No other powers have units adjacent to our borders.\n2. Our goal is to expand by capturing more supply centers. Portugal is a neutral supply center adjacent to us that we can capture this turn. Moving into Burgundy positions us strategically against Germany for future offensives.\n3. Analysis for each unit:\n   - A GAS: Can move to BUR (Burgundy). Since Burgundy is unoccupied and adjacent, we will move A GAS - BUR. We risk a bounce if Germany also moves into Burgundy, but we accept this risk given our strategy.\n   - A SPA: Can move to POR (Portugal) to capture the supply center. Moving A SPA - POR directly allows us to claim it. We will support this move with F MAO to ensure success.\n   - F MAO: Can support A SPA's move to Portugal. By ordering F MAO S A SPA - POR, we provide the necessary support to secure Portugal without interference.\n   - We have no adjacent enemy units to attack, so we focus on expansion.\n4. Decision: Issue orders A GAS - BUR, A SPA - POR, and F MAO S A SPA - POR.\n5. Verification:\n   - All moves are to adjacent regions as per the adjacency list.\n   - We are not moving into our own controlled regions.\n   - We are not attacking regions occupied by enemy units.\n   - Our support order is valid as F MAO is adjacent to POR and can support A SPA's move.\n   - This plan aligns with our goal to expand and prepares us for future actions against Germany.",

Supporting A SPA's move ensures we secure Portugal, while moving into Burgundy aligns with our alliance with England and sets the stage for potential offensives against Germany. Maintaining peaceful relations with Italy keeps our southern border secure.",

Moving F WES to MAO strengthens our naval control over the Mid-Atlantic, ensuring we have flexibility in future naval operations. Relocating A GAS to BRE positions our army closer to the northern front, allowing us to react to any developments with England or Germany.

To honor our non-aggression pact with Italy and build trust, the Army in Rome will move to Tuscany, demonstrating our commitment to withdraw from Italian territories.

Our Fleet in the Irish Sea (F IRI) will move to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean (MAO) to increase our naval flexibility. In the south, we aim to extend our naval presence towards the east by moving our Fleet in Tunis (F TUN) to the Ionian Sea (ION), supported by our Fleet in Naples (F NAP), preparing for potential actions against Turkey if needed. Our Army in Venice (A VEN) will move to Tuscany (TUS) to reposition and possibly support future operations in northern Italy or southern France. The Army in North Africa (A NAF) will hold position as there are no immediate opportunities for advancement.

We aim to secure neutral territories like Denmark and Ruhr for positioning. 2) Our three units start in Berlin (A BER), Kiel (F KIE), and Munich (A MUN). We own three supply centers (BER, KIE, MUN). Other nations have not claimed Denmark or Ruhr, so those are prime neutral moves. 3) For each unit, we choose moves that expand or position us for growth without conflict. BER -> KIE reoccupies our home center after the fleet leaves, F KIE -> DEN to capture a neutral supply center, and A MUN -> RUH for positional advantage. No direct attacks on occupied territories are planned. 4) We verify we are not attacking our own regions as an invasion, nor are we moving into an occupied territory without support. 5) Each move is valid, adjacent, and satisfies our strategic goal of securing neutral centers and maintaining friendly relations with neighbors.",

We have four units (A KIE, A HOL, F BAL, A SIL) occupying Kiel, Holland, Baltic Sea, and Silesia, respectively. 3) To honor our peace with England, we will not attack Belgium this turn as we do not have assured French support this phase, and a failed attack would sour relations. 4) We will instead move our fleet from Baltic Sea to Denmark to reposition, while keeping our armies in place to preserve our DMZs and avoid provocation. 5) We verified none of our moves violate existing DMZs or alliances; we are not attacking any foreign-held region, nor are we moving into our own regions with the intent to fight. 6) Concluding, we finalize orders that improve our flexibility without breaking alliances or taking unjustified risks this turn.",

                            "step_by_step_reasoning": "0. Review of Negotiation Phase: During negotiations, France and England established a non-aggression pact over the English Channel, and Germany agreed not to move into the North Sea or Belgium. Italy expressed willingness to coordinate in the Balkans, and Turkey showed openness to cooperation against Russia. 1. Current State: Austria controls BUD, VIE, SER, with units in GRE, SER, TRI. England controls EDI, LON, LVP, BEL, with units in LON, BEL, EDI, YOR. 2. Expansion Plans: For Austria, plan to target ALB and BUL due to potential collaboration with Italy. For England, maintain current positions to exploit any unguarded regions next turn. 3. Possible Orders Analysis: 3.1. Austria - Consider moving F GRE - ALB to prepare for joint control in the Balkans with Italy. A SER - BUL for potential future expansion and strategic positioning. A TRI supports A SER to hold for defensive strength. 3.2. England - F LON - NTH to reposition for naval dominance and potentially reinforce the north. F BEL supports F LON - NTH to ensure successful repositioning. 3.3. Both powers aim for strategic positioning over aggressive expansion in this round. 4. Order Decision: Austria focuses on gaining regional influence in the Balkans, while England fortifies its naval presence. 5. Verification: All moves target regions not under our current control, align with strategic goals, and ensure defense while preparing for future opportunities. Orders confirmed valid and within adjacent regions.",
                            "reason": "The strategy is to maintain a strong defensive position while seizing opportunities to expand influence in strategic regions. For Austria, collaborating with Italy and capitalizing on Balkan positioning is crucial. For England, maintaining naval strength in the North and ensuring no German encroachment is key, enabling flexibility for future turns.",
