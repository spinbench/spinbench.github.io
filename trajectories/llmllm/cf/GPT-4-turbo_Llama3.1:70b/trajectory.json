By doing so, I'm creating two possible ways for me to connect four of my tokens: either by forming a horizontal line from column 1 to 4 or by building up on the side of the board.

Placing an 'X' in column c3 is strategic as it blocks the opponent's possible win in the next move horizontally, and it also builds on my vertical potential in a central column.

By doing so, I'm creating a new possibility for myself while also putting pressure on X's position in the center. Additionally, placing my token in this column will give me more flexibility for future moves and make it harder for X to anticipate my plans. Furthermore, since X has already focused on controlling the center column, they might not expect me to start building a strong presence on the left side.
