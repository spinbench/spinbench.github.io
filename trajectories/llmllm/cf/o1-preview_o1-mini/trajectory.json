This sets up the potential for a horizontal line of tokens from columns c2 to c5 on row 5. By starting to build a horizontal line, I can force the opponent to respond defensively in multiple columns, increasing the chances that I can form an unblocked line of four tokens. Additionally, controlling the center columns (c2, c3, c4) maximizes opportunities for vertical, horizontal, and diagonal connections.
