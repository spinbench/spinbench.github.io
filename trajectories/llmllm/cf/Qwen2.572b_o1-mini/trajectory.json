To proactively counter this threat and prevent 'X' from gaining an advantage, placing my 'O' token in column 4 is strategically advantageous. Dropping an 'O' into column 4 will occupy the bottom-most available space at (5,4), effectively blocking 'X' from extending their horizontal line to the right.

Secondly, by strengthening my presence in c1, I control a central column, which is crucial for maximizing opportunities to create connect fours both vertically and horizontally.

Controlling column 1 also provides flexibility in creating diagonal connect fours, further enhancing my strategic advantage.
