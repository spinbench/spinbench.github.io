By doing so, I begin forming a potential vertical line of four 'X' tokens, which is one of the winning conditions.\n\nControlling the central columns (especially columns 3 and 4) offers more opportunities for creating vertical, horizontal, and diagonal connections due to their central position on the board. Placing in column 3 keeps my options flexible for future moves.\n\nCurrently, there is no immediate threat from the opponent that requires defensive action. The opponent has placed an 'O' in column 2 (c2), but with only one token there, I don't need to block them yet. Focusing on advancing my own winning strategy is the priority at this stage.\n\nTherefore, by placing in column 3, I maximize my chances of building a winning sequence while maintaining control over the central area of the board.",
