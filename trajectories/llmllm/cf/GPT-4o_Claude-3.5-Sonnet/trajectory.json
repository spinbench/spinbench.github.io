This gives me an OO sequence that has expansion possibilities. 3) Column 5 is still close to the center of the board, maintaining good board control. 4) This move doesn't create any immediate vertical winning opportunities for my opponent in column 5. 5) It maintains flexibility for future moves while forcing the opponent to play defensively rather than continuing their offensive strategy.",

Additionally, they have two horizontal X tokens at (5,2) and (5,3). The most urgent threat is the diagonal one, which can be blocked by placing my token in column 3, at position (3,3).
