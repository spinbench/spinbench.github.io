        "reason": "I choose column 3 (center column) because it's strategically the strongest opening move in Connect Four. The center column provides: 1) Maximum flexibility for future connections in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals), 2) Control of the board's center, which is crucial for both offensive and defensive play, 3) The most potential winning combinations as it can be part of winning sequences in multiple directions. Starting in the center also prevents my opponent from taking this advantageous position.",

Additionally, it allows me to form a potential horizontal connection with my existing 'O' in (4, 3) and (5, 4) as well as prepare for a vertical connection in future turns.
