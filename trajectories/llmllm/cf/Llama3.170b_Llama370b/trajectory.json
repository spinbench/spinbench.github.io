By controlling the center, I'm also forcing my opponent to respond to this strategic position, which may give me an advantage in terms of dictating the pace of the game. Additionally, if my opponent tries to place their token directly next to mine, I can easily block them by placing another token on the other side, further solidifying my control over the center.",
