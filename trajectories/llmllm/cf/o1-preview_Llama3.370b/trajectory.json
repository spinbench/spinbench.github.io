However, my opponent has made a strong push in the center with their 'X' tokens, so I must also consider blocking their potential sequences. Since column 2 (c2) is almost full of 'X' tokens and I already have an 'O' token in column 3 and 4, placing an 'O' in column 3 is not possible to create a direct sequence of four. Hence, I will place my token in column 5 (c5), which gives me flexibility for the next moves and might also force my opponent to reconsider their strategy.",
