It is the center column of the Connect Four board, which allows potential connections in all directions: vertically, horizontally, and diagonally on both sides. This placement maximizes the options for creating a line of four tokens and also provides opportunities to block the opponent's potential connections. Starting in the center often forces the opponent to respond defensively, thus giving an upper hand in dictating the flow of the game.",
