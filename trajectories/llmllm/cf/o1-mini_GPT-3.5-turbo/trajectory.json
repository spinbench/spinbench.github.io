Dropping another 'X' in column 4 at position (5,4) creates two adjacent 'X' tokens, laying the groundwork for a potential horizontal connect four by adding tokens in columns 5 and 6 in subsequent moves.

This move extends the horizontal alignment of 'X' tokens at the bottom row, creating a potential pathway for a horizontal connect four in subsequent moves. Additionally, occupying column 5 helps control more central positions on the board, which are crucial for setting up both offensive and defensive plays. By doing so, it limits the opponent's options to create their own connect four threats and provides greater flexibility for future moves, including the possibility of forming vertical or diagonal connections.",
