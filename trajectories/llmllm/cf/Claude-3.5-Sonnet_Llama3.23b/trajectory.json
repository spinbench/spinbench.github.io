Maximum Flexibility: From the center position, I can develop my strategy towards either side of the board.\n3. Strategic Advantage: Controlling the center limits my opponent's options and forces them to either block my potential connections or play defensively.\n4. Future Potential: A center piece gives me the most possibilities for future four-in-a-row combinations.\n5.
