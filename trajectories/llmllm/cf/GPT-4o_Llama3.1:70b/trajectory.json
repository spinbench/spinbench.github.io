This strategy provides the most flexibility and maximizes opportunities for creating horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections. Controlling the center gives me an advantage in both offense and defense, as it allows for more potential alignments and can help block the opponent's moves more effectively later in the game.",

My opponent placed their token in column 3, which is central and versatile for potential connections in multiple directions. I want to continue exerting control over the central area, as it provides the best opportunities for both horizontal and diagonal paths. By placing my token in column 2, I can begin to establish a horizontal line and prepare for potential diagonal connections, while also keeping options open for future vertical moves in case the opponent continues stacking in column 3.

Additionally, placing my token in column 2 will also put pressure on X's position and force them to respond, potentially creating a weakness elsewhere on the board.",
