        "reason": "For my opening move, I will choose column 3 (the center column) because:\n1. The center column is strategically the most valuable position in Connect Four as it provides the most opportunities for future connections in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals).\n2. It gives me control of the center of the board, which is crucial for both offensive and defensive play.\n3. From this position, I can build towards either side of the board.\n4. Studies and game theory analysis have shown that controlling the center column gives the highest probability of winning.\n5. It forces my opponent to respond to potential threats that I can create from the center.\n6. If my opponent doesn't block the center column in their next move, I can potentially stack another token on top, increasing my winning chances.",

Column 2 provides a balanced approach of defensive positioning and offensive potential, countering the opponent's initial central strategy.",

Alternative moves would be less optimal:\n   - Playing too far from my current token would lose the advantage of building on my existing position\n   - Playing adjacent left would be defensive rather than offensive\n5.
