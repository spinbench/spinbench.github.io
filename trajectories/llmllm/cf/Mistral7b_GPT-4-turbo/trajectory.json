This move also strengthens my position by closing off potential diagonal line opportunities for my opponent, while keeping some gaps for future moves open. The empty row r6 and the gap between rows r4 and r5 indicate that this area might be underdeveloped for my opponent, which means I can potentially establish a stronger foothold in this part of the board.",

Firstly, it starts to form a base adjacent to my existing token in column 3, potentially allowing for horizontal connections in future moves. Secondly, it begins to create a defensive screen to block or disrupt any horizontal or diagonal threats that the opponent might aim to establish around the left side of the board where they have begun stacking tokens. This move also keeps options open for vertical plays in the near-central columns, which can be crucial as the game develops.",

With these considerations in mind, I select column 6 as it limits the opponent's options significantly.",

It is entirely open and allows me to start forming a vertical line, potentially setting up future plays for either horizontal or diagonal connections. Placing a token in column 2 starts to centralize my presence on the board, potentially giving me more flexibility in responding to or initiating threats across the middle of the grid. Furthermore, this move does not immediately threaten a win by the opponent and it keeps my options open for expansion in multiple directions.",
