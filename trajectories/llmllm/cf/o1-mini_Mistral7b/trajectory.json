If 'O' places two more tokens in this column in subsequent moves, they will achieve a vertical four-in-a-row, resulting in an immediate win for them. To prevent this imminent threat, it is crucial to block column 0 by placing an 'X' token there. Additionally, maintaining control over this column ensures that 'O' cannot easily diversify their strategy and create multiple winning opportunities elsewhere on the board.

By stacking another 'X' in column 3, I am building towards a vertical connect four while simultaneously maintaining flexibility to pursue horizontal or diagonal alignments.

Placing an 'O' in this column also allows me to potentially control column 6 (c6), which could become a crucial part of completing a four-in-a-row.

By placing another 'X' token in column 3, it will occupy position (2,3), creating a vertical line of four 'X' tokens in column 3. This immediate vertical alignment will secure a win for me.
