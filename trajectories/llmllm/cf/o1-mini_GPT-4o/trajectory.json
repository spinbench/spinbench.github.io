By placing an 'X' at (r3,4), you prevent 'O' from easily building a vertical connect-four in future moves.\n\n2. **Expanding Your Own Opportunities:** Adding an 'X' to column 4 allows you to create potential horizontal and diagonal connections in subsequent turns. It also balances your token distribution across the board, which is crucial for creating multiple threats.\n\n3. **Maintaining Central Control:** Controlling the center columns (c3 and c4) maximizes your chances of forming connect-fours in various directions (vertical, horizontal, and diagonal). This central dominance makes it harder for the opponent to find advantageous placements.\n\n4. **Preventing Opponent's Double Threats:** By occupying c4, you reduce the opponent's ability to create multiple simultaneous threats, forcing them to play more defensively.\n\nOverall, placing an 'X' in column 4 not only blocks the opponent's immediate threats but also sets you up for creating your own winning opportunities.",
