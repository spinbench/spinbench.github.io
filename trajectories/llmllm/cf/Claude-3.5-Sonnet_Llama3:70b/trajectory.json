The center column provides the most opportunities for creating winning sequences in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals)\n2. Controlling the center is a key strategy in Connect Four as it limits opponent's options and maximizes my own\n3. From the center position, I can build towards either side of the board\n4. Professional players often favor the center column for the first move because it offers the best strategic advantage\n5. A token in the center can be part of winning sequences in 4 different directions, compared to only 3 directions for other positions and 2 directions for corner positions\n6. By taking the center first, I prevent my opponent from gaining this advantageous position",

Defensive Consideration:\n   - By placing my token in column 4, I prevent the opponent from using this strategic central position\n   - It indirectly defends against potential diagonal threats from the opponent's current position\n\n4.
