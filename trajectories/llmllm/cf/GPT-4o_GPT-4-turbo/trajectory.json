The opponent has built a strong vertical presence in column 3 with two 'O' tokens, and they can extend it to a threat of three-in-a-row if they place another token there. To prevent this and stop them from making a vertical connection, I must place my 'X' token in column 3 to block them. Additionally, this move aligns with my plan to establish multiple paths to victory. By placing my token in column 3, I also have the opportunity to eventually create a vertical stack of 'X' tokens there or expand horizontally by placing tokens in columns 2 and 4.

This move serves both a defensive and offensive purpose. Defensively, it prevents the opponent from creating a vertical line of three 'X' tokens in column 2, which would strengthen their position for a future move to connect four. Offensively, it keeps options open for us to potentially build across multiple rows in central columns, and can be part of a setup for a diagonal connect in future turns.
