By predicting that they might develop a knight, it seems prudent to move my pawn forward to e5, taking control of more central squares and potentially challenging their pawn structure. However, since this is the opponent's turn, I will focus on preparing for my next move. The most logical choice for the opponent would be to move the knight on g8 to f6, which opens possibilities for better board control. Hence, to prepare for that response and immediately strengthen my control over the center, I choose to reinforce with e5. My move will set the stage for further development and counter-play against their pieces.
