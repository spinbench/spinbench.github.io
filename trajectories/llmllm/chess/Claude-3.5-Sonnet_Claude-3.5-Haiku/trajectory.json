This aggressive push gains space and forces Black's knight to relocate, typically to d5. While this creates a target for Black to attack, it gives White a strong central presence and good development prospects. Following this move, I can prepare to support the e5 pawn with moves like d2d4 and potentially develop my knight to f3, creating a solid pawn chain and good piece coordination.",
