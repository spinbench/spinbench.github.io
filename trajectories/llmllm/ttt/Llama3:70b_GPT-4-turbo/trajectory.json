Placing an 'O' at index 0 allows for potential horizontal and diagonal lines to be formed later in the game. Corners typically open up multiple opportunities for creating winning combinations and can serve as a defense against the opponent's next moves, especially with the center already occupied by 'X'. This position can help set up future plays and defensive blocks against the opponent, particularly along the diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right and the top row.",
