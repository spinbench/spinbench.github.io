To prevent this, I must place an O at index 8 and block the winning move. However, index 8 is not a legal move at the moment. The best strategic alternative is to continue planning for a win and look for opportunities in the remaining legal moves. Observing the legal moves, I can see that placing an O at index 6 doesn't immediately block or create a win, but it sets the foundation to potentially form multiple lines of attack (building towards a vertical win through index 3, which is another legal move, or row-based win through index 0, which is already occupied by X; thus doesn't hold potential). Index 6 holds an edge position that can support future win scenarios while maintaining positioning advantage.",
