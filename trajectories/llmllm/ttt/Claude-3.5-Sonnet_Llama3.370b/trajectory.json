The center controls the most possible winning lines - both diagonals, one horizontal, and one vertical line (4 winning possibilities total). This gives me maximum flexibility for future moves and forces my opponent to play defensively. If they take a corner next, I can respond by taking the opposite corner to create two winning threats. If they take an edge, I can take a corner to create diagonal winning opportunities.",
