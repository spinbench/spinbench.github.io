It maximizes the number of potential winning combinations and provides flexibility for subsequent moves. Controlling the center allows for opportunities in every direction (horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals) and can help dictate the flow of the game. This central position places 'X' in a strong position both to build towards victory and to block potential moves by 'O'.",
