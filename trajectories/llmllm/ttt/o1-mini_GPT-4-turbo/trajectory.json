It also helps in setting up potential two-way threats, which are beneficial in complex game situations. This move does not immediately threaten 'X', but it sets up a better position for future moves, keeping options open for forming sequences both vertically along the 0-3-6 line and diagonally across the board on the 0-4-8 line.",

Occupying this corner allows me to create multiple potential winning lines, including the vertical line (6-3-0) and the diagonal line (6-4-2). By securing this position, I increase my chances of forming a fork, which can provide two simultaneous threats that the opponent must block, thereby forcing them into a defensive position. Additionally, placing an 'X' in the corner complements my existing center position, maximizing the flexibility and strategic advantage of my moves, while minimizing the opponent's opportunities to establish a strong offensive setup.",

Position 3 is also aligned with an existing O, enhancing the potential for completing a horizontal line (positions 0, 3, 6) where two slots already contain O.
