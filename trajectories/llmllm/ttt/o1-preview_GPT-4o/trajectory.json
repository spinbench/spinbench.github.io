If we then place 'X' at index 2 on our next turn, we complete the anti-diagonal line (indices 6-4-2) and win.\n\n2. **Right Column Win:** With 'X' at indices 6 and 8, if we place 'X' at index 7 on our next turn, we complete the right column (indices 6-7-8) and win.\n\nBy creating dual threats, we force the opponent into a dilemma where they can block only one of our winning opportunities on their next move.
