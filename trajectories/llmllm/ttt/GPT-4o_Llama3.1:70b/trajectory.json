Position 1 is strategic because it gives me the opportunity to complete a horizontal line using positions 1, 4, and a potential future move in position 7. Additionally, it helps build a vertical threat from positions 1 and 4, where placing in 7 later could result in a win.

Position 7 is an attractive option as it allows me to create a possible row or column win, while also providing an anchor point for a diagonal line.

To prevent 'O' from winning with a move in position 2, we must place an 'X' there. This move not only blocks the opponent but also sets us up to potentially win in future turns as we maintain control in both our current row and column.
