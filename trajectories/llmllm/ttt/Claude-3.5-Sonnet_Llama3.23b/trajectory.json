        "reason": "As the first player, I choose the center position (4) because it's strategically the strongest opening move. The center controls the most winning lines (4 potential lines - 2 diagonals, 1 horizontal, and 1 vertical), giving me maximum flexibility for future moves. This forces my opponent to respond defensively, typically by taking a corner. Even after they take a corner, I'll still have multiple paths to victory. The center position also prevents my opponent from creating an immediate threat through the center, which would be possible if I left it open.",
