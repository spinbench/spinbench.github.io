This move creates two potential lines for forming a winning combination: the diagonal from top-left (cell 0) to bottom-right (cell 8), and the bottom row (cells 6, 7, 8). By controlling a corner, I maximize opportunities for creating multiple threats, forcing the opponent to defend in multiple directions. Additionally, occupying a corner complements my center position (cell 4), enhancing my control over the board and increasing the likelihood of setting up a fork in subsequent moves. This strategic placement helps in forcing a win by creating scenarios where the opponent cannot block all potential winning lines simultaneously.",
