The center square (index 4) offers the most opportunities to create multiple winning paths, controls the board's critical junction, and forces the opponent into a reactive position. By occupying the center, I maximize potential line creation strategies (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) and create psychological pressure by claiming the most strategically valuable square. This move prevents the opponent from easily establishing their own strategic lines and sets up potential future winning configurations across multiple directions.",

Corners are part of three potential winning lines (row, column, and diagonal), enabling 'O' to build threats in various directions. By occupying a corner, 'O' also limits 'X's flexibility to create forks, as 'X' cannot easily set up multiple threats from the center. This move not only positions 'O' advantageously for future offensive plays but also enhances defensive capabilities by controlling key areas of the board. Consequently, choosing cell 0 provides a balanced approach to both offense and defense, increasing 'O's likelihood of securing a win.",
