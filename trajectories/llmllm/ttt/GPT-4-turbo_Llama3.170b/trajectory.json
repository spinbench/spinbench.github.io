The top row (0, 3, 6) is too exposed to a potential X block or win. However, placing an O on position 5 will give me the opportunity to create a diagonal line (O-O-O from positions 0-5-8 didn't work because my opponent took 8), a vertical line with future moves on 2 and then potentially on 7 if needed, and also limit X's options for expansion on the right side.
