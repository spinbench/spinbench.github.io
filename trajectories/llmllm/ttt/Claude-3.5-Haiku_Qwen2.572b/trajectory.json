The center provides the most opportunities for creating winning lines in multiple directions - horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. It offers maximum flexibility for future moves and forces the opponent to react to my positioning. By occupying the center, I create the most pressure and potential paths to victory, making it the most mathematically sound opening move in Tic-Tac-Toe.",
