Occupying a corner allows 'O' to set up forks, which can lead to winning in multiple directions, while also limiting 'X's ability to create their own threats.

By placing my X in this spot, I'm preparing for possible lines that could develop along the top-left or left-middle axes. Additionally, this move doesn't commit me to a specific row or column yet, keeping my options open for the next moves.

Currently, 'X' occupies cells 2 and 4, which sets up a potential diagonal win through cell 6. By placing 'O' in cell 6, I prevent 'X' from completing this diagonal and maintain control of the board.

The center cell (4) is not available in the list of legal moves. Among the available options, placing a mark in position 5 will give me a good opportunity to create potential lines and limit my opponent's options.

Since they've placed two marks in the top row (0 and 6), it's likely that they'll aim for the top-center space (3) to complete their line or block mine. Given this expectation, placing my mark in the center-left space (1) won't directly threaten their existing marks but will open up possibilities for me to create a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical line while also preparing to potentially counter their next move.
