Placing my 'X' in the center provides maximum flexibility and control, creating multiple potential winning line opportunities. It forces the opponent to react defensively and gives me the best initial board positioning to develop a winning strategy. By occupying the center, I maximize my chances of creating intersecting threat lines and maintain strategic initiative.",
