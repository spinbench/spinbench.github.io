Choosing a corner is a strategic move because it allows me to work towards creating a line while also providing opportunities to block the opponent's future threats. Placing in a corner often sets up potential forks or advantageous positions in future moves. Since 'X' is already in the center, taking a corner gives me the flexibility to respond to their next move and look for ways to create multiple winning lines.",
