I must block potential winning paths while creating my own.

If I choose cell 2 instead, the opponent will take cell 7 and win. Therefore, by placing an 'O' in cell 7, I prevent their win.

The center of the board (X at position 4) gives me multiple line possibilities, and this final move at position 2 maintains my strategic advantage.",
