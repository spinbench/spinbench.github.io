For optimal results:\n\n1) Provide clear, specific prompts.\n2) Use it to answer the original query through step by step reasoning for tasks without complex or multi-step reasoning.\n3) For complex queries, break them down into subtasks and use the tool multiple times.\n4) Use it as a starting point for complex tasks, then refine with specialized tools.\n5) Verify important information from its responses.\n6) For image-related tasks, ensure the image path is correct and the prompt is relevant to the image content."
